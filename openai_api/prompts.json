However, from a customer perspective, rather than knowing the appropriate category, they rather have a real-world task they would like to fulfill (e.g., travel) and it would be more desirable to search for the product using its intended usage. For example, a laptop may have uses that range from gaming to office work to school. Similarly, a pair of sports shoes may have different uses such as running, tennis, basketball, or soccer. Certain dresses could be used for formal occasions such as weddings, while others are more suitable for a casual lunch outing. \nThe use cases are extracted from E-commerce product reviews. The use cases are written down as a comma-seperated string.

It did help me cope with the subzero temperatures and I'm grateful. However, I also looked forward to using it as a battery pack and I was rather disappointed. I was never able to get it to charge my phone. All the cords were connected and it seemed fine but my phone never got charged. Not even for a second. Also, even when I think I've charged it fully, the light on my device continues to flash orange. Perhaps I got a faulty one. Still, it's useful as a hand warmer - I just wish I got to use it as a battery pack as well.\\\"\\nUse cases: hand warmer\\n\\nReview: \\\"I didn't expect this to be a high quality dart board but I did expect it to work. No matter how hard or soft you throw a dart, when it hits the board it drags down at least 3 inches. This is a horrible product and it is not usable in the least bit. Don't waste your money. Spend an extra $10 and get a real magnetic dart board if you still want a cheap one.\\\"\\nUse cases: No use cases\\n\\nReview: \\\"I ordered these for our restaurant's floor drains after dealing with repeated clogs and an expensive bill to have a plumber snake out the pipes.  The baskets catch all the bits of food coming out of the sinks, without impeding the flow of water.  It was necessary to remove the dome strainer from the drain in order for the basket to sit low enough for the metal grate to sit on top.  The basket is sturdy and came in white.  My only complaint is the price for such a simple plastic item.\\\"\\nUse cases: restaurant's floor drains, catch bits of food coming out from sink\\n\\nReview: \\\"{review['review_body']}\\\"\\nUse cases:",
