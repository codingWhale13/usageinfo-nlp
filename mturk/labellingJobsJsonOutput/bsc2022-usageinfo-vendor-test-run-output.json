I am a firm believer that when we read books we bring pieces of ourselves to the work. Our lives and our experiences help us connect with the writing. When I read Becket's book of Haikus, I found myself having such strong emotional reactions to many of the poems. I couldn't help but read them multiple times, and with each read, I discovered new meaning and depth. That alone shows the power of Becket's ability to transform simple words into profound meaning.  As a fan and follower of Becket on social media, I look forward to his postings of his poetry. There are days when his poems speak volumes. There are moments when I swear that he's written the poem just for me. So often I'll write his words down and carry them around with me as a reminder that I am not alone. Someone else understands how I feel. His poems remind me that I am just one small piece of a much bigger puzzle. That is a precious thing.  Becket has a true talent for assembling words in a limited amount of space that create a powerful impact. I envy his strength with words. To be able to convey intimate feelings and emotions so that others connect with them and react is a rare gift. Poetry is no simple thing.  Carefully selected words. Short well-written phrases. Powerful effect.  I am delighted that Becket has decided to publish his collection of Haikus for the one who needs them. I know that I most certainly need them. I will absolutely read this book many more times, and I will no doubt share and hold some of the poems near to my heart as I continue to gain strength from the simple power of Becket's words.  I highly recommend Becket's work to anyone that enjoys reading poetry. His words are profound and clean. There is something for everyone in this compilation of his poems. Personally, I want to thank Becket for his work. His words have given me strength on many days when Ithought I might not make it.

I am a firm believer that when we read books we bring pieces of ourselves to the work. Our lives and our experiences help us connect with the writing. When I read Becket's book of Haikus, I found myself having such strong emotional reactions to many of the poems. I couldn't help but read them multiple times, and with each read, I discovered new meaning and depth. That alone shows the power of Becket's ability to transform simple words into profound meaning.  As a fan and follower of Becket on social media, I look forward to his postings of his poetry. There are days when his poems speak volumes. There are moments when I swear that he's written the poem just for me. So often I'll write his words down and carry them around with me as a reminder that I am not alone. Someone else understands how I feel. His poems remind me that I am just one small piece of a much bigger puzzle. That is a precious thing.  Becket has a true talent for assembling words in a limited amount of space that create a powerful impact. I envy his strength with words. To be able to convey intimate feelings and emotions so that others connect with them and react is a rare gift. Poetry is no simple thing.  Carefully selected words. Short well-written phrases. Powerful effect.  I am delighted that Becket has decided to publish his collection of Haikus for the one who needs them. I know that I most certainly need them. I will absolutely read this book many more times, and I will no doubt share and hold some of the poems near to my heart as I continue to gain strength from the simple power of Becket's words.  I highly recommend Becket's work to anyone that enjoys reading poetry. His words are profound and clean. There is something for everyone in this compilation of his poems. Personally, I want to thank Becket for his work. His words have given me strength on many days when Ithought I might not make it.

In this regard, propylene glycol reacts with a mixture of unsaturated maleic anhydride and isophthalic acid to give a copolymer. This partially unsaturated polymer undergoes further crosslinking to yield thermoset plastics.<br /><br />Propylene glycol is used as a humectant (E1520), solvent, and preservative in food and for tobacco products, as well as being one of the major ingredients of the &#34;e-liquid&#34; used in electronic cigarettes along with vegetable glycerin.<br /><br />Propylene glycol is also used in various edible items such as coffee-based drinks, liquid sweeteners, ice cream, whipped dairy products and soda.[8][9]<br /><br />[5] Propylene glycol is used as a solvent in many pharmaceuticals, including oral, injectable and topical formulations, such as for diazepam and lorazepam which are insoluble in water.[10]<br /><br />Like ethylene glycol, propylene glycol is able to lower the freezing point of water, and so it is used as aircraft de-icing fluid.[5][11]", "label": {"isFlagged": false, "annotations": [{"start": 361, "end": 364, "tokens": ["aircraft", "de-icing", "fluid"], "tag": "", "color": "#8afd8a"}], "customUsageOptions": [], "replacementClasses": {}}, "workerId": "vendor.eu-central-1.96b1ee5eec130ef4", "workerInspectionTime": null, "inspectionTime": null}, {"review_id": "R2E9IOTV2SC4UK", "product_id": "B004G7PTB8", "product_title": "King Canopy Ball Bungees, 50 Pack, Black", "review_date": "2014-10-13", "product_category": "Lawn and Garden", "review_body": "works great", "label": {"isFlagged": false, "annotations": [], "customUsageOptions": [], "replacementClasses": {}}, "workerId": "vendor.eu-central-1.96b1ee5eec130ef4", "workerInspectionTime": null, "inspectionTime": null}, {"review_id": "RFHVSHYZGN1S9", "product_id": "B00JU6BN9C", "product_title": "Game of Thrones Seasons 1a and 2 Coaster Set, Total of 8 Coasters", "review_date": "2014-10-25", "product_category": "Kitchen", "review_body": "We ordered this combo set, anticipating 8 total coasters.
