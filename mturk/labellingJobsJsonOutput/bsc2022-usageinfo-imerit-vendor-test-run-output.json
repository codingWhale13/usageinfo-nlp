I bought this fan about 6 weeks ago from The Warming Store and it has already stopped working properly. The low setting still works but it goes slower than it did originally. The high setting turns on for about 2 seconds and then stops. It will keep trying to start but then jerks and/or only spins once and stops again. The high setting is completely useless now.

I will not get into all the positive details because all this review is to point out a couple of cons and I want to keep this simple.  There are many very good detailed reviews talking about all the pros already so no point in restating them.  There are two cons and I wish I knew about then before I purchased the phone, and did not read about this information in the reviews.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1. First, there is no audible sound letting you know you have messages, something I thought was standard on all answer phones these days.  But you can program the phones to have a small blinking light when there are unread messages through the code system so not too bad.<br /><br />2. This is my biggest con, and I cannot figure out why phones have to be so complicated.  You would need a small college course to learn everything.  There are 47 pages of detailed instructions on how to use all the features.  You should be able to navigate to a function using an intuitive menu, not having to look everything up in a book.  One example that I could NOT find this in the instructions is that when someone calls you but does not leave a message, you get the words \\\\\"Missed Call\\\\\" on the phones' displays.  There is no easy way to delete this so basically your phone will always say \\\\\"Missed Call\\\\\" and you will always wonder was this an old call or a new call.  Here is the 9+ step solution to delete it from your display:<br /><br />a. Hit the \\\\\"Menu\\\\\" button<br />b. Hit the \\\\\"#\\\\\" button<br />c. Look up code in book (it is 213)<br />d. Type in \\\\\"213\\\\\"<br />e. Hit \\\\\"Scroll List\\\\\"<br />f. Find phone number to delete<br />g. Hit \\\\\"Erase\\\\\" button<br />h. Scroll to \\\\\"Yes\\\\\"<br />i. Hit \\\\\"Select\\\\\"<br />j. Now, if you received 10 calls, do this 9 more times<br /><br />3. There are two pages of codes for you to use to program with.  I doubt you will memorize them so you will need to keep the instruction book out for reference.<br /><br />4.

The pricing on Badgers had gone up over the past decade, so I looked elsewhere and found the Waste King.  Good price, good ratings, so I took a chance.    So far, so good.  The motor sounds a lot different compared to the Badger, but it works fine.    If you're at all handy, the installation of the actual unit is pretty easy.  But I do have a few pointers.    1.  Make sure the rubber cushion mount ring is seated properly on the sink flange.  Just the top lip of that rubber ring should seat in the channel of the flange.  It is easy to seat the rubber ring too high, one notch up, so to speak.  It looks right, it feels right, but it's not right.  If it's too high up the flange, it won't let the metal mount ring slide down enough.  You'll lift up the disposer and there won't be enough clearance for the bayonet-mount (those nubs)on the disposer unit to mate with the mount ring. Pretty frustrating at the time.  But once I found my mistake, it was easy to hang the disposer.    2.  Go ahead and put some soft soap on the bottom of that rubber ring before you hang the disposer.  I didn't, and it took a bit of effort to get that mount ring turned fully.  A little soft soap should make it slide more easily, and the less you torque on everything down there, the better.      Other than that, it was a piece of cake.  As mentioned, it comes ready to plug into an outlet.  If you don't have an outlet, you'll have to add one, or wire hardwire the unit using the included directions.", "label": {"isFlagged": false, "annotations": [], "customUsageOptions": [], "replacementClasses": {}}, "workerId": "vendor.eu-central-1.6c61fbd0b69ec0f3", "workerInspectionTime": 151560, "inspectionTime": null}, {"marketplace": "US", "customer_id": 13701984, "review_id": "R18AB91ESA5208", "product_id": "B005FMK4YU", "product_parent": 405515615, "product_title": "pink leopard design phone case for the HTC Evo 3D", "product_category": "Wireless", "star_rating": 1, "helpful_votes": 0, "total_votes": 0, "vine": "N", "verified_purchase": "Y", "review_headline": "The design peeled off in a week!", "review_date": "2014-09-09", "review_body": "The design peeled off in a week!", "label": {"isFlagged": false, "annotations": [], "customUsageOptions": [], "replacementClasses": {}}, "workerId": "vendor.eu-central-1.6c61fbd0b69ec0f3", "workerInspectionTime": 20784, "inspectionTime": null}, {"marketplace": "US", "customer_id": 26631107, "review_id": "R1KJ70O22Q2SRD", "product_id": "B00063466U", "product_parent": 120352270, "product_title": "Petmate 25-Inch Burrow Bed, Navy Blue", "product_category": "Pet Products", "star_rating": 5, "helpful_votes": 107, "total_votes": 108, "vine": "N", "verified_purchase": "N", "review_headline": "WHAT A DEAL!", "review_date": "2004-10-13", "review_body": "This is a great little pet bed!

This is a very good recreational tent, really can't complain after one overnight use with my 2 kids. It is a great size for 2 or 3 people, more than that and you're cramming in.  Fit and finish are very nice, and when pitched and staked, it is a very sturdy tent. Not at all useful for backpacking any real distance, but easy for car camping or a short walk in. I saw one review complaining about moisture inside the tent, to combat this, you can either leave the windows and door open, or cease to breathe. It's condensed water vapor from your breath. It dried out in less than five minutes when I opened the tent up in the morning.<br /><br />First setup took 10 minutes to figure the thing out, but I believe now 60 seconds would be realistic (to set it up, another couple minutes to put stakes up). To set it up, you unfold it, straighten out the legs until they pop straight (no buttons or anything, and there are soft pads over the joints, i'm guessing they are there to protect the tent when it is folded up), the last pole over the door can be put into its sleeve before you straighten it out. Make sure all the little hooks from the tent are around the poles, they were already on on my tent. Then extend the ends of the four corner poles. They telescope out, which raises the tent. I didn't see the telescoping parts for a while and the instructions are bare bones, it wasn't obvious.<br /><br />I had never seen the self rolling windows before, and I really don't understand what the instructions are trying to picture, but basically they are flat springs that work like slap wrap wristbands. They come rolled up in the stake bag, I assumed they were tape or patches or something. To use them You open the Velcro opening under each window, straighten the roller spring completely, and push it up the channel. Then when you want to roll the window up, you just push it in a little bit to set the spring into action and let", "label": {"isFlagged": false, "annotations": [], "customUsageOptions": [], "replacementClasses": {}}, "workerId": "vendor.eu-central-1.5c8c81d19a849ef7", "workerInspectionTime": 291612, "inspectionTime": null}, {"marketplace": "US", "customer_id": 21236077, "review_id": "R38PT0O9TFGUKS", "product_id": "B00EKSX9VK", "product_parent": 545369884, "product_title": "Cressi Mens's Long Sleeve Rash Guard For Swimming, Surfing, Diving", "product_category": "Outdoors", "star_rating": 3, "helpful_votes": 0, "total_votes": 0, "vine": "N", "verified_purchase": "Y", "review_headline": "like youth sizing", "review_date": "2014-11-01", "review_body": "Fits VERY small... like youth sizing.", "label": {"isFlagged": false, "annotations": [], "customUsageOptions": [], "replacementClasses": {}}, "workerId": "vendor.eu-central-1.5c8c81d19a849ef7", "workerInspectionTime": 24360, "inspectionTime": null}, {"marketplace": "US", "customer_id": 15921770, "review_id": "R2OY8X8EYI1HS0", "product_id": "B005VCCV90", "product_parent": 864682200, "product_title": "Ocean Avenue Women's Summer Safari Tankini", "product_category": "Apparel", "star_rating": 5, "helpful_votes": 2, "total_votes": 2, "vine": "N", "verified_purchase": "Y", "review_headline": "Beautiful tankini", "review_date": "2012-06-27", "review_body": "I got this tankini in the mail quickly.
