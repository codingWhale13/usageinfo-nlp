Nice tripod while it worked, but soon after buying it a locking button on one of the legs quit working, now I have a tripod with one leg that will not lock.  This tripod is now living in the back of my closet along with the rest of the 'junk' photography equipment I've accumulated over the years.  I recommend any potential buyer pass this product by, it is simply an inferior design that won't last long.    Follow up:  My review & opinion of the tripod remains unchanged.  I want to note, however, that within 24 hours of placing my review I was contacted by the seller who apologized for the problems I had and shipped me a replacement free of charge.  Hopefully, I won't have problems with the replacement, but a big thumbs up to the seller for going above and beyond in standing behind the sale.	2014-08-18

Thankfully, I had some folks insist that I get a &#34;decent camera&#34; for this trip. After some research I was deciding between the D3300 and D5300, the latter of which, from what I can tell, is just a D3300 with GPS, WiFi, and slightly better autofocus. My wife and I decided that the extra $500 (give or take) wasn't worth it given our limited abilities as photographers.<br /><br />This camera was great for the price. Again, I'm no pro, so this was perfect for our purposes and took some great shots. The GPS on the D5300 would have been nice, but we still are very happy with our purchase.<br /><br />The included lens was good for standard shooting, though we got the Nikon 55-300mm lens for shooting wildlife as well	2015-04-24

This flash is great for the price and I would have given it a 5 star rating had it not been for my camera upgrade. I recently upgraded from the 650D to the 5D Mark II (A huge upgrade). Not even thinking twice I attempted using this on my new camera with no flash. The first thing I thought was, \\""Oh no, my camera is broken,\\"" but thankfully for me (but not this review) the fault was in the flash. I thought it was funny because we found out my Canon was fine after using a Nikon flash on it.    Long story short: Don't completely trust all of the models this flash advertises to work with.    I would not recommend this product to a photographer who owns a Cannon 5D Mk II.    I would recommend this product to a photographer who owns a Cannon 650D (T4i) and is looking for a quality flash on a budget."	2015-01-28

Ordered this several months ago & really haven't used it yet. I bought this so my husband could watch TV in our bedroom & i could sleep without being wakened to loud volume. However I did not realize when i bought this, that you have to connect it on the cable box of the 'audio out' port. (my fault for not thinking ahead lol)  therefore everytime he would want to use this would mean I have to unplug/replug often to switch between TV volume or the headphones.  Had I being thinking more techie before i bought these, I would have found wireless headphones that would have a switch on the headphone receiver box to switch them on or back to the TV setting. These do not give you that option. And if you are like most of use, its hard to get to the back of your cable box since they are in entertainment centers or on shelves where you have just about unplug the cable box to get to the back of it	2015-02-13

It easily paired to my iPhone 5.  Music sounded great.  When speaking on the phone, callers could hear me clearly.  BUT....when I would get a call while I was listening to music, the headphones would switch over fine to take the call, but they would not switch back to my music.  When I would play my music, it wouldn't stream out of the headphones, just the speaker on my iPhone.  Id press the phone button on the headphones and that would turn on Siri so I know it was still bluetooth connected.  I had to go into my Bluetooth settings, disconnect the headset and re-pair to get it working again.  I reached out to LG for some support but they were completely useless.<br /><br />This was my first purchase of an LG product.  I ended up returning the headphones instead of getting a replacement.  If I can't get a brand new unit working out of the box, I'll try my luck with a different manufacturer.	2014-09-26

It's a nice and durable plastic casing. The picture however isn't imprinted on the plastic case.<br />Rather, it's a separate plastic film that you can interchange at your will.<br />Because of this though it requires a bit more instruction then a usual 3DS case.<br />Not to worry though, even though the instructions are in Japanese, the step by step diagram is more than enough to discern what you are supposed to do. Which honestly isn't that hard at all.<br />Overall, this case is bound to make your 3DS stand out. Seeing how this is a Japanese exclusive.<br /><br />I will admit though, the $20.00 price tag is a bit much for what the actual contents are, but that's the consequence of buying imported products.	2013-02-20

I got these for him when he was two months old and gently helped him hold one and guided it to his mouth. He was immediately interested. They fit his hands perfectly and they even helped him develop his gripping skills.<br /><br />They are super soft with no rough edges anywhere and have no chemicals or finishes on them, which makes me feel good about him wanting to put them in his mouth and gnaw on them all day long. I have tied a silk scarf on one of them which gives him two nice textures to explore. I have left them as-is, unfinished, and give them a quick rinse every couple of days and allow them to air dry. Some people have mentioned they sealed them with olive oil, please don't do this as the olive oil will go rancid, which is very unhealthy (this is why it's not used on butcher blocks). If you want to use oil, use food-grade mineral oil (the kind that's used on butcher blocks).	2015-08-22

I have both a four-year-old and a toddler, and so if we're walking somewhere, I usually put my younger child in the stroller and have my older child walk alongside of me. This stroller hook is a great little handle for him to hold onto. I can easily attach it to the stroller frame with the velcro and I can adjust it to the perfect height and position for him.<br /><br />It's also very handy for hanging a diaper bag or purse. I felt like it held my bags securely. The hook curves up quite a bit, so I didn't worry about my bags sliding off the handle. I liked that it kept my items easily within reach (rather than having to store a bag in the bottom basket of my stroller. It made it easy to grab out snacks and cups, or my cell phone. The green grips helped to hold items in place (and gave my son something comfortable to hold onto).	2014-01-24

I recently bought this cd for him (I already have it).  It is very interesting to listen to being it was their 1st Christmas album, especially compared to the other releases.  I love listening to all their albums, and this one especially.  It has a sound unique to it...released in 1984, it kinda has that 80s vibe to it, but yet when played with the others, they all blend well together.  I highly recommend this album, and any holiday album by Mannheim Steamroller.	2012-12-13

A smoothly recorded jazz quartet, playing original music in a style deliberately and strongly influenced by the Coltrane quartets.<br />Mr. Herbert has made it his mission to play in that multi-noted, post-bop, sheets of sound saxophone style, and it really does evoke the spirit and the feeling of a Coltrane session, as does his live playing.<br />  The other soloists all have something to say, but their styles are their own. Todd takes that Coltrane Sound, a title of one of JC recordings, as I recall, and makes it both timeless and modern.<br />  In the rock music world, their are many so-called &#34;tribute&#34; bands. The jazz world is coming around to this concept, and Todd Herbert makes it seem not only do-able and realistic, but sensible and a natural outgrowth of creativity. The production is dark and uniform, rather than reverbed-out and all pop-music dramatic.<br />88melter	2014-04-13

And boy was 2009's \\""All Shall Fall\\"" a highly-anticipated release if there ever was one. Indeed, by boasting the classic Immortal line-up (with Abbath on guitar and vocals, and Horgh on drums), and by enlisting Hypocrisy great Peter Tatgren to turn the nobs, the band were poised to truly take the black metal world by storm with one of the most highly-anticipated comeback albums not only of the year (2009), but also of the decade.<br /><br />At the end of the day, though, \\""All Shall Fall\\"" does not live-up to previous Immortal releases like \\""S.O.N.D.\\"" or 1999's \\""At The Heart Of Winter.\\"" But that does not mean it isn't still a good album. It is, after all, brimming with all of the band's trademarks -- serrated riffs, impeccable drumming, a brutal-yet-simultaneously tuneful overall sound, and Abbath's croaking vocals that should be instantly recognizable to anyone that has been exposed to music in the last couple of decades. Unfortunately, it is the songwriting that is the problem, as the album takes a while to really get off the ground. (And only a couple of parts fully detonate.) Plus, even though there is not even one stinker to be found in this whole bunch, there are only a couple of truly classic cuts present, here.<br /><br />The clear standout comes three tracks in, with \\""Hordes To War,\\"" the set's sole skull-cracker. And what a ripping, roaring, and piping-hot song it is, too, and a blast of brutal blackened thrash metal reminiscent of Immortal's watershed release, the aforementioned \\""At The Heart Of Winter.\\"" Here, on this straightforwardly bludgeoning, frills-free noggin-buster, the listener is treated to a breakneck tempo, which is complimented nearly perfectly by a whipping guitar solo, and gobs of great, modern thrash riffs, scalding guitar leads, gargly vocals, and slamming blast beats. It all makes for one extremely sweet and thrilling onslaught, and one that is likely to stay with the listener for quite a while after first hearing it.<br /><br />The rest of \\""All Shall Fall\\"" is not without merit, though. The eponymous track kicks things off on an ominous note, with a feedback-laden intro. But in almost no time at all, BAM!, the instruments kick in, thus transforming this number into a propulsive set opener. And, needless to say, it is one that has plenty of really cool, skin-crawling, robotic-sounding vocals. And what's even better than this is \\""The Rise Of Darkness,\\"" which begins with an ominous bass line before blasting into a fast drum intro. And this, in turn, gives way to fiery, briskly chugging riffs and galloping drums. But there is the occasional slow breakdown found here, even if the vocals remain as brutal and unintelligible as ever; and later on, the song does adopt an interesting melodic section with (what sounds like) a keyboard solo. All told, \\""The Rise...\\"" is one really diverse, dynamic, surprising, and memorable tune, and an extremely epic one, at that. \\""Norden On Fire,\\"" then, is another huge standout, on account of it beginning with a little bit of ambient melody (stemming from its use of lightly-strummed acoustic guitars). Fear not, though, because soon enough, the electric guitars boom onto the scene, and eventually lock into a fiery, propulsive, surging thrash groove.<br /><br />For another highlight, check out \\""Arctic Swarm,\\"" a catchy and head-bangable c hugger that is fast and heavy without ever ascending to breakneck speeds, and one that is backed by industrial-strength, churning riffs. And its outro is also very much of note, as it is highlighted by a terrifically memorable and mazy melodic guitar solo. And rounding out the album, there is \\""Mount North,\\"" which has a really memorable, fist-raising chorus -- but it is mainly a highlight on account of it featuring skillful, thrashy, blistering, and Slayer-ish chaotic soloing; and \\""Unearthly Kingdom,\\"" which features some ominous female backing vocals and spine-tingling melodic intro from Are Mundal.<br /><br />\\""All Shall Fall\\"" is a big, intense, and certainly very dangerous Immortal album, even if it does not quite live up to its pre-release hype. So, sure, by most accounts, it comes close to but ultimately comes up a little short for being the kind of absolutely amazing, front-to-back killer record that fans were waiting for. But this is still a worthwhile and impressive release, overall., thrashy, blistering, and Slayer-ish chaotic soloing; and \\""Unearthly Kingdom,\\"" which features some ominous female backing vocals and spine-tingling melodic intro from Are Mundal.<br /><br />\\""All Shall Fall\\"" is a big, intense, and certainly very dangerous Immortal album, even if it does not quite live up to its pre-release hype. So, sure, by most accounts, it comes close to but ultimately comes up a little short for being the kind of absolutely amazing, front-to-back killer record that fans were waiting for.

I drove 5 hours through Hurricane Sandy to get this generator. I wasn't sure I wanted a diesel or whether it was going to be big enough for the job. As promised, we lost power for about 4 days. Luckily I had time to add oil to the engine and bleed the fuel lines to get it started before the power shut off. After that, I had it hooked up to two 1 h.p. sump pumps in two different buildings using too much extension cord. I ran it out of the back of a pickup with a cap to keep it dry and had no issues using it that way.<br /><br />I would periodically take it to my house to keep the refrigerators cold. I then wired my house panel so that the generator could power the whole house. I have all gas appliances and heat, but well and septic pumps. It had no issues powering everything I needed in the house. My electrician checked voltage and cycles/sec and everything checked out great. It would run about 10 hours between refueling and it never ran out of fuel.<br /><br />The two issues are that the wheels are kind of cheesy and the GFCI 110v outlet tripped, would not reset and had to be replaced. I bought one at the local hardware store and was back in business. Other than than those two issues and i would have rated it 5 stars.<br /><br />I ran it for 65 hours on the hour meter the first time used it and it worked great for me.	2012-11-06

Also when I am charging it - the cord is kind of in the way and it makes it harder to press the button quickly.  It might be an age thing - young people may be used to smaller buttons and it won't be a problem for them.	2015-02-26

If you're not a heavy user	When I first installed this drive I was blown away! After rebooting 3 times and loading all of my regular apps, the load times hit amazing speeds.  Win 7, Outlook, Word, Excel, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Adobe Audition, Sony Vegas Pro...<br /><br />I quickly ordered 2 more hybrids, but eventually sent them all back.<br /><br />The problem: I work with a lot of large audio files, some video, and photos. After a regular day of basic office work and some editing of large files, the cache was flushed/replaced so that my fast loading basic apps were no longer loading quickly. I did a lot of timing tests and ultimately, by midway through a work day the load times of my apps that i wanted quickly were slower than my previous 7200rpm drive.<br /><br />If you only work with basic office apps, surfing and don't use large data sets, this drive is fantastic.<br /><br />Otherwise, you'll end up with slower performance than you probably have right now.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION FOR SEAGATE:<br />1) let the user 'set'/load the cache!  If you provided a simple tool to let users &#34;lock&#34; the cache periodically, or even to see what's loaded and select, it would make a world of difference.  For me, the big time killer is waiting 20-30 seconds for a commonly used app to load.  when cached, this was down to 2 seconds - great!  But, after flushed from the cache it was taking 50% longer to load than on my 7200rpm drive<br />2) increase the cache - Seagate tested the average office user and found 8G was adequate. If they had a 16G cache option, it might have worked for me. Certainly heavy data apps need more than 8G<br />3) you're creating a fast drive to be an interrim step to an SDD - why run at 5400? why not use a faster drive, which usually equates to faster transfer?<br /><br />This drive is a great attempt. Hoping they'll come out with a Pro version with the above noted features.	2014-02-18

Ive worn these for a few days so far, so things may change as they burn in & compared to my year old Razer Carcharias, but so far:<br />Sound Isolation, considering these are foam/cloth, they isolate pretty well for what they are. Better than the Carcharias.<br />Heat, they are a tad bit warmer since they are closed and not open, so you detect a small amount of heat around your ears after some time.<br />Mic, I'm going to say that both mics are close in quality, but I feel like after reviewing some palyback, that the G430 has a bit worse quality than the Carcharias. The Carcharias however, picked up much backstatic when using, no matter how clear the mic was. Also with the G430, the automatic mic sound cancelling thing messes up the mic a lot. Your voice gets cut out when talking, unless you talk in a loud voice. Only way to fix is not using the USB Mic jack and using instead just the 3.5mm plugged directly into PC while the Audio jack is put into the USB for the surround sound still.<br />Sound in general, The Bass & Lows are definitely better than my Carcharias. However at the moment, I feel like the Highs don't sound very clear, again, maybe some burning will fix this, but kinda bugs me.<br />Surround sound, new to surround sound headsets, but using it in L4d, Borderlands2, TF2, sounds okay, nothing amazing I'd say. Stereo gives a definite advantage either Left or Right of you, while Surround noticeably lowers the volume at which things are being made from. Example would that a gunshot from your front right 20meters away would be VERY hard to hear, while a close gun shot would be VERY loud. Once you attune yourself to this type of gameplay, I can see how it can be an advantage, but I was doing alright with just Stereo settings as well. I use it mainly more for immersion, but even then...still feels kind of weird heh.<br />Comfort, good. I think my Carcharias would be more comfortable though. Tip of my ears touch the inside back of the ear pads, kind of making them ache after a hour or so.m ache after a hour or so.	2014-04-03

These headphones are worth more than their measly price tag. They offer top notch, no-fuss high quality sound. They are aslo great for identifying the whereabouts of threats around you. Having an aural clue to the position of your enemies is extremely useful. You also feel a lot more immersed in the game- things happen around you not in front of you. I also like that you can toggle the sound via the device on the cord- no more fiddling with my stupid TV remote. Come to think of it- I used to have to alter the sound quite a bit- down when in battle (as sounds got pretty intense and loud) and up when exploring and talking to NPC's. But now I can hear everything comfortably at a stable sound level. Awesome! Oh, and they're really comfortable too- they accommodate your unique head shape. And they are comfortable to wear with my Gunnars too. Haven't tried the mic yet but I am confident it will be just as good as they say! :) you won't regret buying these!	2013-01-01

I initially purchased these from a home improvement store locally, but they stopped carrying them between the time I initially purchased the gloves and the time I went to replace them after working them hard for many months.

The box is not the one pictured I bought this as a gift. I have an older set that used the box in the picture. It was a cheap box but it was sturdy and it worked. The box this comes with was bent out of shape when it arrived, and the latch did not work. The internal parts are hinged with screws and single nuts (nothing to keep the nuts from coming loose). One of the screws was cross threaded. I had to replace all the screws & nuts with new ones and I used lock nuts to keep it from falling apart.<br />The drills in the box I got appeared to be straight. A bunch had fallen out of their holes, and at least one escaped the package it was shipped in since the set was missing a drill. Having read the reviews of other kits, I measured all of the drills. Some measured correctly, some measured up to 2 mils small, and at least one of the small numbered drills was duplicated. The machining of the drills was ok, but not great. at least on of the drills had a corner chipped off, a couple I looked at had asymmetric faces, and often it looked like the grinding wheel used for sharpening needed to be dressed. My guess is that these are factory seconds.	2015-01-17

In fact we were on the water for 5 hours and didn't even drain the battery past 80%. I would definitely recommend this for people who are the same size as us. I wouldn't put more than 2 people in our size though as the space was just right for the 2 of us. The next day me, my girlfriend & our 3 year old daughter went out on it to just ride around and again plenty of room. We could've even put another child in with us. Hope this helps."	2012-07-05

I was already a fan of Bill Mauldin's cartoons of Willie & Joe, and had read his book &#34;Upfront&#34; several times.  I thought this set looked beautiful and evoked a WWII Army feel.  I was not disappointed!<br /><br />Volume 1 is full of cartoons depicting all the highs and lows of Army training in the first year of the war.  Volume 2 follows Bill to Sicily, Italy, France, and Germany through the characters of Willie and Joe.  The cartoons are well-reproduced, usually one per page.  The large size means that the cartoons are fairly large as well, letting the reader truly appreciate every stroke of the pen.  A bonus I did not expect was a collection of a few higher-resolution reproductions at the conclusion of each volume, with accompanying information on each of the images.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Bill Mauldin's work, or the American fighting man of WWII, this is a great showcase piece.	2015-03-05

It offered everything you look for in a Payne novel(the virtual reality-like immersion into another person) but not a Twisp novel (the wit and wry Shakespeare-like thwarted ambitions). Obviously not as good as the original Twisp trilogy Youth in Revolt, or its two sequels that dealt directly with Nick Twisp, or even the sequel dealing with his cousin. But it answered a lot of questions whilst not spoiling the clean endings provided to the other Twisp legacies, while giving you another prime Payne novel. I would recommend saving this book for second to last after reading all his other novels.	2015-04-14

Excerpt From: Becket. “Haikus for the One Who Needs Them..”  Hope is a moment of choice between despairing or persevering.  I am a firm believer that when we read books we bring pieces of ourselves to the work. Our lives and our experiences help us connect with the writing. When I read Becket's book of Haikus, I found myself having such strong emotional reactions to many of the poems. I couldn't help but read them multiple times, and with each read, I discovered new meaning and depth. That alone shows the power of Becket's ability to transform simple words into profound meaning.  As a fan and follower of Becket on social media, I look forward to his postings of his poetry. There are days when his poems speak volumes. There are moments when I swear that he's written the poem just for me. So often I'll write his words down and carry them around with me as a reminder that I am not alone. Someone else understands how I feel. His poems remind me that I am just one small piece of a much bigger puzzle. That is a precious thing.  Becket has a true talent for assembling words in a limited amount of space that create a powerful impact. I envy his strength with words. To be able to convey intimate feelings and emotions so that others connect with them and react is a rare gift. Poetry is no simple thing.  Carefully selected words. Short well-written phrases. Powerful effect.  I am delighted that Becket has decided to publish his collection of Haikus for the one who needs them. I know that I most certainly need them. I will absolutely read this book many more times, and I will no doubt share and hold some of the poems near to my heart as I continue to gain strength from the simple power of Becket's words.  I highly recommend Becket's work to anyone that enjoys reading poetry. His words are profound and clean. There is something for everyone in this compilation of his poems. Personally, I want to thank Becket for his work. His words have given me strength on many days when Ithought I might not make it.  Excerpt From: Becket. “Haikus for the One Who Needs Them..”  Be strong through the hurts. Things will get better in time. Hold on awhile more.	2015-05-03

It’s about a rich girl named Alix who attends an elite highschool (uh oh, it’s already starting off wrong for me) who meets a mysterious sexy bad boy (oh gosh) who leads a diverse gang of socially conscious teenage vandals (ugh) who hope to change the world by taking down a public relations company that works for industries like Big Pharma. They hope to do this by stalking Alix and showing her how bad her father, one of the owners of the company, is.<br /><br />At first Alix, after she finally figures out what the mystery stalker is all about, isn’t willing to believe that her father, a man who takes such good care of his family, could be so cold-hearted toward the rest of the world. Ah, but Alix has the hots for the sexy bad boy stalker (it wouldn’t be a YA novel otherwise), so she begins to investigate his claim. Could her awesome father be such a villain? And, if so, should she blow the whistle?<br /><br />Up to this point I have loved everything I’ve read by Paolo Bacigalupi. His excellent story collection Pump Six and Other Stories is one of my favorite collections because it’s full of unique and fascinating stories. The Doubt Factory, on the other hand, doesn’t live up to my expectations because of its clich&eacute;d YA tropes and its heavy-handed message. However, it’s exciting and I may still find myself recommending the book to my Research Methods students because it sheds light on important issues that I care and teach about: how industries such as Big Pharma are able to confuse “truth” in such a way as to either get dangerous products on the market or delay getting them removed. Sometimes they use shoddy research techniques, biased reporting, shameless lobbying and deceitful advertising, all to make money off an ignorant populace. All they have to do, as the title of Bacigalupi’s book suggests, is to create doubt. The people who do this may be very nice people who are just doing what their job requires. Bacigalupi asks at what point we should hold them personally accountable and shows us that even a teenage girl can make a difference.<br /><br />I like this message, but wish it had been delivered with more nuance. After finishing The Doubt Factory, I had learned something, but I felt like I’d been flattened with a steamroller. And I definitely could have done without all the icky teenage stalker bits. Alix lets the stalker into her house at night, goes to meet him in an abandoned factory, gets in his car, and other things…. I thought she was stupid. Meanwhile Sexy Stalker thinks she’s amazing, not a “sheep” like all the other girls, and that she’s going to change the world. His evidence is that when confronted with the news about her father, she starts Googling to find out the truth. I feel like Bacigalupi doesn’t give teenage girls enough credit if he thinks that’s all it takes to make a girl stand out from the crowd.<br /><br />So, while I appreciated Bacigalupi’s Message, and while I admit that the story will be educational and probably thrilling for most teenage readers, I wished for less typical YA drama and more subtlety. I may recommend the book to my students because of the Message about research ethics, but not to my kids because sleeping with your stalker just isn’t cool.<br /><br />I listened to Listening Library’s audio version of The Doubt Factory which is 12 hours long and read by Emma Galvin. Ms Galvin gave a terrific performance. Her voices and pacing were excellent. If you plan to read The Doubt Factory, I recommend this version.create doubt.

The love Ernest shows her and the love she has for her toy and the joy of sharing are all very evident.<br /> For very young children, this is great but for a child who likes to ask questions, this book holds plenty. Such as &#34;Why didn't Ernest just rescue the frozen toy?&#34;  Is Ernest her dad?  She lives with his so he must be.  Why doesn't she call him that and why is he a bear and not a mouse like her&#34;<br />When reading this book with a small group of children at the library, I was bombarded with these questions.

The spare tire is off-center on my 2006 Honda CRV, so the bikes stick out beyond the side of the car on the right.  Hasn't been a problem so far -- just have to maintain vigilance to not crowd anything on that side.  Holds both my son's new aluminum-framed Cannondale MTB and my mid-'80s Schwinn Sierra MTB securely, at the same time, even though the top tubes are very different diameters.  Doubtful three full-sized MTB bikes would fit, but I haven't tried it yet. Being able to load the bikes easily from the ground is nice, and the tailgate and rear window still open with the bikes in place.  The only hassle I've had so far is not being able to drive thru automated car washes without first removing the upright piece of the rack from the base (the bit that mounts behind the tire.)  It really should come with 2 keys -- I've yet to get another one made because my local hardware stores don't have a proper blank; think I'll end up at a locksmith.  Compared to the price of some of the \\""name\\"" roof-mount systems, this is a steal, too.  Just have to be careful about backing up! (Of course, with a roof rack you've got to be careful of garages, carports, etc.)<br /><br />Addendum: I ended up ordering two keys direct from Surco (contact info is on its website); I believe it was about $9.

I was very wary of buying this because of the reviews on Amazon (mainly about it not sticking) but the draft coming from my windows (in NYC apartment) was too unbearable. So I bit the bullet and bought it at a Home Depot.<br /><br />I've been repurchasing this product for the past 2 years. It really works wonders, preventing the draft from my AC unit (which I do not remove during the winter because of its massive weight).<br /><br />The steps I take are pretty much outlined by other customer's who have reviewed the item positively (I learned this on my own but found it consistent with other people's instructions).<br /><br />Much of the angst against the product is that it doesn't stick well - it's probably because they're not taking the proper care to ensure that the tape is stuck - or the area have not been prepped correctly.<br /><br />1. Clean the area where you're going to be applying the double sided tape.<br />- In my case: Wooden frame with matte paint<br />2. BEFORE applying the double sided tape, make sure the area is DRY and WARM. I have found out that if the area is cold, the double sided tape will NOT stick properly. I used a hair dryer to warm up the area.<br />3. Once the double sided tape is placed onto the area. The top-side will NOT be sticky yet because you have not peeled off the non-stick layer YET. Use a cloth or folded paper towel to rub down the tape. This will ensure that the tape is sticking properly.<br />4. Peel off the non stick layer and apply the plastic<br />5. Trim off the excess plastic<br />6. Rub down the area where the plastic is stuck on the double sided tape - Similar to Step 3<br />7. Use a blow dryer on the plastic and you'll see that it'll tighten up. Do this till you're satisfied with it's look (don't worry, it won't tighten up OFF the tape if you've followed the instructions)<br /><br />Once done, the plastic should almost be invisible. I've had guests over who looked out the window without even noticing the plastic there.	2014-01-08

I recently got a used desk that had floor glides rather than wheels which I would prefer. Two of the glides would not unscrew all the way and one of the inserts that holds them in place broke. So, I decided to buy new inserts which would also help in making sure the threaded hole was the right size for the wheels I would be getting (I bought the same brand of wheels),<br /><br />These do not pop in easily but, then again you would not want them to go in too easily as that would make things less sturdy over time.<br /><br />The wider section at the bottom was actually slightly larger than the inside of the square tubing that make up the legs of my desk. So, I used a 5-pound sledge hammer to tap them down into place.<br /><br />This sheared off the excess material giving a good snug fit (I was able to scrape the plastic from around the edge that had been sheared from the insert during installation).<br /><br />This product was EXACTLY what I needed and is probably more stable than the original threaded inserts,<br /><br />If you have a piece of furniture with square legs and need a threaded insert to hold glides or casters I would highly recommend these!	2014-10-25

With this new shower head I actually enjoy taking a shower again! Each of the two heads can be used independently or both at the same time. Each of the heads also have adjustments for the pattern of the spray. Not only does this shower head make showering a pleasure, the sprayer arm makes it easy to clean the shower. I have also used it to clean the cooler after a day at the beach, rinse out a trash cans and bathe the dog. Definitely a great buy!	2015-08-16

The lamp shades are different hues of teal/turquoise, not blue.  When you turn the knob to turn it on the first time, TWO bulbs light up.  The second turn of the knob turns those off and the other three on. The third turn of the knob turns on all FIVE. Light positions are adjustable.  Great product.

There are so many factors that can influence the process and it's an emotionally difficult time for any couple. When my wife and I were trying to have a baby, we explored all sorts of things and I wish we had been able to read this book back then. The book suggests a diet that might help the fertility process and at the very least will get the mother healthier in general.

Before I read this book, I thought it would be my least favorite in the series because I haven't really liked Anthony in any of the other books. He always seemed overly cocky with little to show for that attitude. I am glad I was WRONG! While Anthony didn't surpass my love for Thomas, I loved him after reading his story. He finally became a three dimensional character instead of someone that just had a couple of lines in someone else's story. And Max. Damn, that girl is awesome! Talk about an independent woman...she is one. And she calls Anthony on the carpet quite a few times.

I had heard from a literary agent I know that Gray is &#34;a new writer to watch&#34;, who has a lot of buzz in publishing circles, so I was expecting something along the lines of Susanna Clark or Michael Cox. This is definitely a page-turner. It's a book with a very strong, gripping story that, if it were longer, you would stay up late reading. But it isn't so much a literary novel as I was expecting.

The cliffhanger at the end of fighting to live had me so pissed off and desperate for more. I was off to amazon so fast I made my own head spin. I'm not one to leave spoilers but WTF CANADA, WILL AND JAKE?!?!?! Really?! As much as you are drawn both male characters Jake is relentless, even more so after Will's return. Then that whole mess with her memory. I've been reading this to my hubbs...you know zombie bonding time...and he HATES Jake. Every time I say his name he gets a look like Will would get and makes crappy comments about why he isn't dead yet and if he were Will he would've killed him by now. We both questioned Canada and her not searching for Will herself. No matter how injured or how much pain she was in she always took part in everything else so for her not to help search for her hubbs i found that unbelievable. Like i thought for sure that they would have to pull her back and keep her safe from endangering herself further. I really thought she would run into a zombie laden house to find him by herself. but she did nothing but stare at the house...it was hard for me to believe that. I can get that she was in shock and it's diff when it's someone that close to you but Will was her everything and to just be like okay and leave him, nah that's not her. I get why it went that way. Opening up the story line for Jake and his bipolar ass. Ya I think he's worse than her. As awesome as it is they are willing to gave save everyone, where in the hell are they gonna stay?!?!? they don't have these apartments built yet and i'm freaking out all the noise from the house is gonna call the horde....the big one.....the one so massive it tears the house down to the foundation! But I will tell you this....I'm sooooooooo looking forward to reading about Sara getting what's coming to her and I want to know what was in that effin picture!!!!!

The ties of family that bind and yet tangle and even cut are explored almost right out the gate.  Setting this up to be the novel the blurb promised me.<br /><br />However I found the constant under current of, well, scorn, that the author has for the characters simply undermined my interest in what happens to them.  Throw in a slightly odd structure in story telling and I just felt the book never quite came together in an interesting enough way.  I actually felt at times that the author didn't even find her characters sympathetic or that interesting.<br /><br />The only thing that keeps this from a lower rating is that Pierpont can write.  Her prose is smart if the story it is used to tell wallows a bit too much by the halfway point to make it a good book.	2015-08-09

The writing was fine, the story was interesting, the characters were well-done, but it just...didn't connect with me. I didn't dislike it, and can't think of any actual problems I have with it. There's just something missing, some emotional connection that isn't there. Maybe it just wasn't long enough to fully flesh out the situation and engage my feelings. It seemed as if a lot of the time Christian and Juliette spent together was skipped over, so it was hard to understand the extreme feelings they developed for each other. I did feel more connected to Christian, which may be due to the fact that the book starts out with his POV, and we know that he has been watching and wanting Juliette for so many years, trying to stay away from her so that he won't destroy her, all the time knowing that he is unable to be that unselfish.<br /><br />I will probably try another book by this author, maybe something longer and more fully fleshed-out.	2014-03-24

As the first I've read of Guy Portman's work, I didn't have anything to base any expectations on. So I didn't know I was really going to crawl behind the civil mask of a charming, but truly inhumane sociopath. Yes, I know, it's in the description. But often that means little at all.<br /><br />There were times I thought the author strove for shock factor, but I was later forced to reconsider this idea. As an example, at one point Dyson engaged in a fairly risqu&eacute;, drug fuelled threesome that was described in some detail. My first reaction (remembering that I rather like a little erotica in my fiction) was to roll my eyes and tisk at the pointless inclusion of base titillation. That is until I realised the whole thing was relayed with as bland a recitation as Dyson's appreciation of pastel shirts or distaste for custard creams, and far less virulence than his abhorrence of the cat-in-heat howls of Celine Dion's music. This is not to say it or any other aspect of the book was boring, but that Dyson's normal human affect was somewhat lacking and the event therefore held no more importance that a stale repast refreshment or daily grande cafe latte extra hot with soy milk from Starbucks.<br /><br />And here-in lies the genius of this book—the dichotomous nature of what Dyson sees/thinks/does and the considered visage he presents the world, all contradicted against his utter disinterest in those same individuals. As readers, we are never told Dyson is a sociopath (other than in the synopsis). We are SHOWN his personality disorder in everything he does. It's subtle but unmistakable. He never remembers names, dehumanises individuals he particularly dislikes ('cause he dislikes almost everyone) as 'it' and, even surrounded by the moribund accoutrements of death daily, is unmoved by it.<br /><br />There is a lot of dark humour here. Dyson is, after all, a well-educated, intelligent, witty man. A lot of this humour is at the expense of the proletariat masses and their/our common, recognisable lives. Disturbingly (considering Dyson's obvious social imbalance), I agreed with a lot of his opinions—the repugnance of the X Factor as a form of entertainment, the forgeability of the Kardashians as a clan, the omnipresence of banal office chatter, the wretch-inducing encroachment of kitsch tat into otherwise somber environs. All of this makes Dyson a frighteningly relatable, though completely unlikable character. Think Dexter with a British accent.<br /><br />All of this is wrapped in wonderful prose, interesting speech patters (that never got on my nerves), good editing and a satisfying conclusion. It was an all out win in my books.humour is at the expense of the proletariat masses and their/our common, recognisable lives.

They confine themselves to things that can be confirmed from multiple sources.  Things such as the distance between places or the number of soldiers.  They seem to run from evaluating the effects of personal relationships between officers on the course of battles.  Yet much about these relationships is documented.<br /><br />One historian remarks that two generals had never met.  This despite the fact that the two men spent over two years together as cadets at West Point.<br /><br />It takes courage to step beyond well supported facts and into documented feelings and attitudes.  Thompson has taken that step.<br /><br />He has drawn together the documents which outline the relationships between Grand and Meade.  He has added elements based on his military service.  This gives us a much clearer picture of what was happening in Virginia during May and June 1864.<br /><br />The Army of the Potomac was an organization riven with relationship problems.  As one corps commander said when directed to cooperate with another commander, put one of us in command, because I will not participate in &#34;cooperation&#34;.<br /><br />It is great to read about the 800 pound gorilla that was in the midst of the Army of the Potomac.	2015-04-29

This review contains a bit of a spoiler, but not much. Tristan and Keisha are back at it after Keisha leaves the BDSM lifestyle because of her issues with panic attacks. Tristan isn't doing well with her away and he too has panic attacks after losing Keisha. He doesn't really know why or that he even loves her. He just can't be without her. They haven't dealt with the issues behind the panic attacks for both.<br /><br />One night before her return to Tristan, she is almost kidnapped, so Tristan hires a slew of security experts to protect her. In the meanwhile Keisha jumps back in to BDSM with Tristan. The trial against her ex is scheduled and she testifies but the outcome isn't what they would have liked. In the midst of this Tristan's ex, Aimee is really close and in the picture, which causes stress for Keisha. They eventually meet.<br /><br />After the trial, Tristan is seen out with a new woman doing things that upset Keisha. They break up. Suddenly Tristan is consumed with heading his security team to find justice and to keep other women from being hurt by Keisha's ex and those associated with her ex.  He eventually tries to reconnect with Keisha, whom he's left standing.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Not a bad book but clearly not as good as the first.<br />Even with that it's a three. I don't understand the fives but to each his/her own in reviews.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Predictable!!!!<br />Multiple predictable plots! Way too many.<br />Why is Aimee leaving so close? Please!<br />Grammar. Goes from first person to third. It was confusing.<br />The 'Fairy Houchie Mommy and Triple G' thing was kind was a waist the last book and this one, book the first book was a five, so it was okay.<br />How is Tristan calling the shots and the head of a security team with the FBI and CPD? Not even possible!!! They are the experts not him, but he's running the show. Far fetched much!<br />And what fool tries to kidnap a cop?<br />He spots something critical to the case but not the FBItrained staff or CPD? Yeah that's believable.<br />Keisha had no back bone.<br />About a little over half way she starts to deal with her panic attacks, but she in a relationship (BDSM) that causes flashbacks. Makes no sense.<br />Tristan was a confusing mess. He didn't deal with his own issues. He was confused about how he felt about Keisha but yet he didn't leave her alone.<br />When Keisha tells him she has someone else waiting to love her and he doesn't respond, that was crazy! No man into a woman is going to let that slide! Period!<br />Even at the end he's still not very convincing about his feelings for Keisha to me as a reader.<br />This may be a bit of a pot shot but the belief that so called 'vanilla sex' isn't as good is a joke. It's pretty exciting in our house. The belief that if you don't call your husband Sir, or not being tied up and whipped its vanilla is hilarious.	2013-11-01

I've read Plague it was awesome.  Pestilence took up where Plague left off. The Plague has spread to the mainland, California. The government/military declared Marshal law, closed borders halted inter, phone. Then citizens were rounded up like cattle and put them in pens. The order was to detain citizen's and /or shoot infected citizens. The world was falling into choas. Sam was still a target for.assassins. What is this world capable of doing?

He’s clearly a character that leaves an impression ...	WOW! Every now and then you pick up a debut novel and finish it wondering how the hell they haven’t already written a few Bestsellers already. Luke Delaney was the most recent author I discovered this was and I can promise you that James Carol is now added to that list. This author is certainly one to watch! The synopsis features Jefferson Winter who has his own business working for numerous agencies. He also is an ex FBI man who happens to be haunted by the legacy of his father who was a notorious serial killer.<br /><br />First off the character of Jefferson Winter is bloody great! He’s clearly a character that leaves an impression as he has a shock of white hair and has an exceedingly high IQ, and that’s just to name a couple of things. He’s been called in by Inspector Mark Hatcher to help on a case where women are being tortured and then lobotomised. The story is split and we see one case where the most recent woman has been snatched and you literally feel her torture. On the other side we see just how Jefferson works and how he tries to work out the killers next move.<br /><br />From around the third chapter I was completely engrossed and frankly wasn’t willing to put this down for anything. I am very shocked that this is his debut as it’s written with the finesse of a seasoned author. From start to finish it’s packed to the brim full of clever plot twists, brilliant characters and quite frankly scenes that will give me sleepless nights. I finished the book and within around 4 minutes had pre-ordered the second book in the series entitled ‘Watch Me’ which is due out 5th August 2014.<br /><br />This debut novel is one of the best I have read since Luke Delaney’s debut last year. This book will have you reading well into the night and will I promise leave you breathless with anticipation for his next case. A highly recommended book, which I think most people, will absolutely love.	2014-07-23

I found these on clearance at our local Toys R Us and thought I'd use them as an incentive for one daughter who was potty training, the other trying to kick a bad habit. Now they love to carry these little muffin girls around the house to play with.<br /><br />These dolls are surprisingly well made. Ours did not really have a muffin scent to them... though who knows how long they were sitting on the shelf before they went on clearance. Also, by buying them in-store I was able to peek into the box to make sure I wasn't doubling up on the same doll. With so many different kinds shown on the box I'm sure a little girl could be pretty disappointed ending up with two of the same kind.<br /><br />You really have to squish the doll into her muffin liner to make her look like a muffin but my kids actually found this a very entertaining challenge and always giggle when they see her turn into a muffin. :) The thing I like most is when you flip the plastic muffin liner it becomes the inside of the dress and provides just the right support for the doll to sit up perfectly with her little legs dangling down. I think this is why our dolls go everywhere, because they can sit and watch my girls color or sit for a tea party. They are just fun little friends to carry around or bring in the car.<br /><br />This is a simple product, no bells or whistles or online codes or anything fancy, just an undeniably adorable and wholesome doll for imaginative play. After the initial two I bought I got two more that are waiting for Christmas as stocking stuffers. I don't know if I would buy online as you don't really know what variety of dolls you are getting but the price is comparable to those in stores.	2012-09-06

When looking at the front of the glasses:  the width from widest point to widest point is exactly 5 inches.  the width from the left edge of the left frame to the right edge of the right frame is 4.25 inches.  the diameter of each frame is 1.75 inch.  the width of the bridge is 0.75 inch.    When looking at the side of the glasses:  the length from very front to very end is 5.75 inches.  the length from the very front to the part where the earpiece starts to bend is approx 4.5-4.75 inches.    These frames are small.  If you have a wide face they probably won't look very good.  If you check your reference images, Vash's glasses *are* indeed narrow, but he has a very narrow head as well.    I gave these a 3 on durability cause I don't know how rugged they are.  They *look* fairly tough, but until I cosplay a few times with them  I can't give final judgement.    The picture is pretty accurate.  The lenses are yellow (not orange at all), and the frames are made from copper.  This worries me because of the potential for oxidization.  Especially since you will sweat in a hot Vash cosplay.    The joint does not bend past 90 degrees (the way many perscription glasses do), so if you wear glasses are are used to that, be careful you don't put undue strain on these.    The case that comes with it is pretty nice.  The glasses fit inside perfectly (no rattling around at all), and it's solid copper so very crush-resistant.  Lined on the inside with a velvet-like material to prevent scratches.    Hope this helps.  Good cosplaying to you all!	2007-07-19

Somehow it is my wishful thinking that my train-loving son (2 year old) would love to stack different pieces together and make it running. Instead he picks every pieces and throws them away just to hear the big bang. The edges of the blocks are quite sharp.  To avoid breaking furniture and glasses,  I quickly wrapped it up and hope he will like to play with it in a year.	2013-12-01

It  had way more detail to it then I was expecting, I love that you can turn its head 360 degrees, pose the eye stalk  and both the gun and sucker attachment are pose able adding a more accurate feel to it. I'm not sure how well this would hold up to being played with the eye stalk and the arms seem fragile and easy to snap off but the body is fairly solid. Its great sitting on a desk people immediately recognize it or its the first thing they ask about! Bottom line if your looking for a unique Dalek for your Doctor Who collection or something crazy to put in your office you cant go wrong with this little guy!	2012-10-01

While it was already assembled (just had to place the glass protectors and glass on top) which was nice, I found the color to be an utter disappointment. It was neither a warm bronze nor anywhere near the metallic family. I anticipated it being anything ranging from vivid gold to the more antiquated look, but instead it was a flat, rather ugly, muddy brown (if I'm generous, I'd say that it's a warm brown in direct sunlight, but I'm not feeling particularly generous). Sure, it's an easy fix with a can of spray paint, but I really shouldn't have to resort to this.<br /><br />Also, there is a dime sized scratch on the glass. It's frustrating but not worth the trouble to send back since I'll probably place a lamp over it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Unique, fun design<br />Assembled<br />Lightweight and easy to move around but still sturdy<br />Packaged well<br />Great height<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not the color pictured or advertised<br /><br />In the end, I really like this table.

The wood finish looks great and the baskets will definitely hold my towels! It's a well made, sturdy unit.

[[VIDEOID:mo36WO286ESSXPW]]Update: Combating birds!<br />The rain collector, being the highest point on the roof, is a bird magnet.. Conveniently for the birds, when they perch on the rain collector it also serves as a perfect toilet.. I was having to clean it all the time. So I decided to fight back. I attached a perch to the pole which is higher than the collector. Second, I attached punji sticks all around the collector close enough together as to (hopefully) discourage the birds. We shall see..<br /><br /> Assembly consists of popping on the wind cups and installing the batteries. The display is fairly easy to set up and calibrate. Since there is no pressure sensor there isn't much to it. I have a mechanical rain gauge and it agrees well (so far) with this electronic tipping bucket. The temperature/humidity sensor seems reasonable if not just a bit high. I used an old satellite dish roof mount to mount it on the roof of my shop and it went up just fine.<br /><br />The only cons so far are the mounting pole (crooked and seems too small), and the mounting hardware which consists of 2 hose clamps (hardly sufficient for long term installations).<br /><br />The other thing I am skeptical about is the design of the rain collector. It is a shallow and rather small cone and I am wondering if it will be accurate in a heavy rain in high wind. Seems like the rain will not collect well but have not had a heavy rain yet to test that theory.<br /><br />Overall, for the price it seems like a pretty capable and uncomplicated device. And it works too!<br /><br />UPDATE: OK, had the big rain event and as I suspected, it was wrong on the rain total. Rain tube about 50 yards away measured 5.2 inches, this one said 4.41 inches. Dropping it one star, but I still like it and would get it again. Have had no issues with it after about a month.	2012-06-02

However, the colors, albeit calming, are not true to the picture.

Nonetheless, I like these colors in my duvet cover as it brings a calming effect into the room.  Okay, I am going to say it again:  I just love my paisley printed cover.	2013-03-20

There is more red, and the trees do not look like the picture at all. But, I gave it a 3 because it is better than something I could do, so there had to have been some talent there.	2014-12-23

I had never even touched a sewing machine prior to taking a class a few weeks ago.  Based on my instructor's recommendation, I researched Janome machines.  One thing I was definitely looking for was a top loading bobbin.  I also didn't want anything computerized...just a good old-fashioned machine.  The Janome Magnolia is working out beautifully.  It was easy to thread and load the bobbin.  I also love how easy it is to change stitches.  I'm struggling a bit with the zipper foot which is different than the one we used in class but hoping to get the hang of it.  I wish this machine came with some sort of cover.  Still have to figure out what to do if I want to transport the machine.  I highly recommend this machine for the beginning sewer!	2012-09-19

I bought this unit several months ago to replace an older Hoover that broke and was out of warranty.  Before that, I had a Bissell that leaked all over.  I never really liked either as both were difficult to use and clean afterward.<br /><br />Well, so far, I am loving this one.  Where do I start?  Before proceeding, you need to understand that I use it a lot.  I have a dog that has an incontinent issue and we are constantly having to clean up after her (why I keep her is beyond me).<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is how much lighter it is than my previous units.  Plus, the tank doubles as a carry handle making it easy to carry.  My wife especially like how easy it is to handle.  I never liked the water/solution tank design on my old Hoover.  It was not attached nearly as secure and would fall out at times when the cleaner got jostled.  Plus, there was no easy way to carry it around when rolling it was not a possibility (like taking it up stairs).<br /><br />Cleaning carpets is easy and I like the placement of the water/solution switch.  At first, I thought it would be a hassle being on the tank instead of the handle, but it is easy to reach while using the cleaner.<br /><br />The really nice thing I noticed about this unit is how easy it is to clean once you are done using it.  Everything and I mean everything, detaches super easy and cleans up in no time.  Plus, everything is marked early well and is intuitive.  The only way it could be easier is if someone did it for me.<br /><br />The only thing I noticed worth mentioning is that the tank can stop suctioning if you treat the unit roughly when cleaning.  There is a ball meant to shut off the suction when the tank is full, and rough treatment can cause the ball to get into the full position.  I only noticed this when I was cleaning my car’s floor mats out in the driveway and I was getting a little frustrated when the unit transitioned from cement to mat (my bad).  I never have had a problem while cleaningthe house carpets.  The fix is to shutoff the unit long enough to allow the ball to fall back into place.<br /><br />I could go on about other features, but other reviews have done a great job.  In short, I don’t think you be at all disappointed purchasing this Hoover carper cleaner.	2014-06-23

They're the most durable useful scissors I've used.  They're great for everything from cutting paper or cardboard to hard plastics, things scissors usually stink at.<br />Only downside is that they are hefty and are bad at getting in tight spaces cutting things like tightly pulled zip ties.<br />Unfortunately:<br />They zip tie the scissors to the plastic so tight you need a scalpel, xacto knife, or another pair of scissors to open.  Terrible irony, if only you had scissors to open your scissors. Would be 6 star scissors except for the cruel packaging (which I just can't hold against the scissors).	2013-09-23

I had another model made by level mount that wouldn't quite work in our new home, so I needed a mount with an articulating arm. This mount is super heavy duty, and I would highly reccomend it to anyone looking for a high quality mount to ensure thier flat panel is secured to the wall.  This mount will not disappoint. It is made with strong powder coated steel. It is not flimsy in the least. You might want to get someone to help you hang the mount,  as it is quite heavy. Overall great purchase, other than the disappointment of not getting a price adjustment after the price dropped just a week after I had placed my order. For that reason, I must deduct a star due to the poor customer service. I would recommend buying this mount, I would just be wary of the company that you are purchasing from, as it is not amazon supplying the mount.	2015-01-01

I used it with one of the popular inexpensive TENS devices you can also get on Amazon to treat my aunt’s painful neuropathy symptoms but the electric current was mostly felt in the little adhesive electrode that you need to attach at the same time and hardly at all in the sock. My aunt felt like she was being shocked under the little round electrode and became too afraid to use the sock.<br /><br />Because I had done a lot of research about TENS for neuropathy pain and I really wanted this to work for her I decided it was worth it to try another sock and purchased this one. I was hoping for a better experience with this sock and can happily say the difference between the two is actually night and day.<br /><br />With these socks you really feel the electric current being spread evenly around your foot. You can tell that the whole foot is getting treated at the same time.<br /><br />Another nice thing is that this sock comes with the electrolyte spray which seems to help the electric current penetrate deeper into the feet. My aunt really loves the spray. It actually also helped the other brand sock work a little better but not like this sock. The big round adhesive electrode that comes with this sock also doesn't shock like the other sock did but instead makes it so you can feel the electric current over the whole lower part of the leg.<br /><br />Just something else to point out is that I was so encouraged by this seller’s products that I went ahead and purchase several other items from them including an Ultima Neuro device that is specifically made for treating neuropathy pain. The other TENS device we tried is a Truemedic and it helped a little with my aunt’s painbut the relief was always temporary. It sends out a very intense electric current that is hard to adjust and so my aunt could only handle the treatment for a few minutes at a time. The current from the Ultima Neuro is soothing and can be finely adjusted and my aunt has become kind of a maniac about using it several times every day.

Seems to work but I'm suspicious as well as uncomfortable because this product, which is not regulated by the FDA, states it is:<br />100% Safe Natural USA made product with NO chemicals, preservatives, fillers or blenders. NO Need for Refrigeration.<br /><br />HOWEVER it contains propylene glycol -  here's WIKI's description:<br /><br />Forty-five percent of propylene glycol produced is used as chemical feedstock for the production of unsaturated polyester resins. In this regard, propylene glycol reacts with a mixture of unsaturated maleic anhydride and isophthalic acid to give a copolymer. This partially unsaturated polymer undergoes further crosslinking to yield thermoset plastics.<br /><br />Propylene glycol is used as a humectant (E1520), solvent, and preservative in food and for tobacco products, as well as being one of the major ingredients of the &#34;e-liquid&#34; used in electronic cigarettes along with vegetable glycerin.<br /><br />Propylene glycol is also used in various edible items such as coffee-based drinks, liquid sweeteners, ice cream, whipped dairy products and soda.[8][9]<br /><br />[5] Propylene glycol is used as a solvent in many pharmaceuticals, including oral, injectable and topical formulations, such as for diazepam and lorazepam which are insoluble in water.[10]<br /><br />Like ethylene glycol, propylene glycol is able to lower the freezing point of water, and so it is used as aircraft de-icing fluid.[5][11]	2015-06-21

I use my invisalign trays so I cannot comment on the trays the come in the kit. It's a slow and steady process but it's definitely worth the time.

I am doing this because I have a whole set of Shun Knifes and they are great cutting tools! My Henkel Knifes do not compare to these when it comes to sharpness. I am sure I will be recommending this type of Chinese Cleaver to others who love the art of cooking as I do.  8:20 P.M.- Never expected for my Zhen Cleaver to arrived this late, but it did arrive as Amazon guaranteed it would. Boy...Oh Boy!! this is a serious Cleaver to say the least!! It is an absolute work of art and it means business when it comes to cutting vegetables. Yes...I put it through the test and cutting veggies could not be easier. The wide blade makes it easy to scoop the vegetables when you are done. Needless to say, I am very happy and recommend this product to anyone serious about owning nothing but the best in kitchen cutlery. Thank You, Joseph Mesa	2015-05-31

The knives are initially very sharp but they don't hold a edge as well as my (much more expensive Shun knives).  But my biggest gripe is that if they are NOT cleaned and dried right away they tend to rust, most annoying.  I've been very careful about this, but when others use them the problems persists; and if the rust develops close to the edge, the edge tends to pit.  This can and has been corrected but I don't know why it should be a problem.  I care these knives the same as I do with a few Shun knives that I have and I don't have the same problem with them.  Probably a different type of steel used, but both have the beautiful layered blades.  The Shuns are 3 to 4 times more expensive than the Calphalon Katana's, they are sharper and stay sharper longer and are a little lighter.  The Kantana's are a good value for what you get, the Shun's are an investment.	2008-10-18

One of the most tedious chores in the kitchen if you're cooking with a lot of fresh garlic is to get not just the outer skin, but that sticky inner skin off the garlic cloves.  This thing makes it easy!  Pop in the garlic, roll it a few times and presto, no more garlic skin.  It takes a couple times to get the hang of it and requires a bit more pressure than I initially thought it would but once you have the technique down, it works great!  I'm not huge on having every single gadget cluttering up my kitchen, but if you cook with a lot of garlic, this is definitely worth it.	2014-06-07

And plenty warm for indoor lounging and desk work.<br /><br />As others have said, they are long (and I'm 6'1&#34; tall), but not too long... a perfect length for me, I think.<br /><br />Nice deep pockets; important for carrying my ever-present iPhone.<br /><br />They are more expensive than others, but worth it, I think; I recently got a second pair.<br /><br />Recommended.	2012-12-10

Immediately the stitching came undone on the armpits but it didn't rip apart too bad so only a few people noticed.  The way it fit was awkward up top and needing to be pinned together but for the price it works alright and really wouldn't be used again anyhow.	2012-10-31

It has 3 spots where you can adjust the length of the straps. Straps are anchored, they are not removable. And the cups are slightly padded. The clasp is in the front, its small and plastic. Runs small. I wear a 40 C and these cut into my ribs. I thought the clasp was going to break or the wires were going to poke through. I would exchange for a larger size, but they don't have them.

These came up in my 'latex free panties' search for my daughter who has become severely allergic to latex. The elastic is NOT completely covered in the waistband. The seams are a bit thick on the sides  also. While well made for long term wear, the seam 'itch' her, she says. Once the waist begins to wear over time the elastic will possible touch her skin as the bottom of the waistband elastic is exposed thru threads. Great panties, but not really made for latex allergic little persons. I have more children so they will be put to use, but should not pop up under the latex free search. :o(	2013-10-12

We were thrilled to find a crate with which we could travel more easily. The crate is very light and simple to assemble and breakdown.<br /><br />BUT, and that is a big BUT, we only used it twice before he figured out how to break out of it. The zipper just isn't strong enough. We decided to turn the crate so that the mesh door faced a wall, BAD IDEA. He was able to turn the whole crate vertically trying to push through it. Not safe for him at all. We also realized there is an area he scratched/chewed through creating a hole in the fabric.<br /><br />This crate was a complete waste of money for us.	2013-12-29
