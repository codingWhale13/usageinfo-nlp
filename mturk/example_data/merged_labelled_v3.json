I worried about how to give  her a pill. No problem, crushed the pill and mixed with wet food. Again, it worked like noting else and NO side effects. Now one pill a week does the trick.",

            "review_body": "This box never worked for me.  I followed the directions to the letter.  First of all, the sides are not tall enough.  My cats got litter every where.  I literally burned up a vacuum trying to get all of the litter up off of the carpet.  Second of all, it never scooped up any of the clumped litter into the little bin.  Third of all, it takes the regular shopping bags that you put into the bin, and they get wrapped around the metal part that turns the conveyor belt, burning out the motor.    I would NOT recommend this box to anyone.  If you want an automatic box, go with something different.  I should have known it was junk when the person at the pet store told me \\\\\"make sure you keep your receipt.\\\\\"",

However, I also looked forward to using it as a battery pack and I was rather disappointed. I was never able to get it to charge my phone. All the cords were connected and it seemed fine but my phone never got charged. Not even for a second. Also, even when I think I've charged it fully, the light on my device continues to flash orange. Perhaps I got a faulty one. Still, it's useful as a hand warmer - I just wish I got to use it as a battery pack as well.",

I design business cards, pamplets, etc. on my computer as a side business while going to college and suffice to say, printing them on this printer can't happen.  Nothing lines up correctly.  It completly ignores the margins I've set.  Everything prints at a slanted angle.  And then to make it even better, it will print say 3 pages perfect and then never print it right again. I have to say that this printer works great for printing non-coloured documents, but DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER if you need it to print on anything other than standard paper.  It will not do it.",

It is narrower than most, which might make it easier for storing when the brew is fermenting, but other than that there is nothing that sets it apart from any other glass jar you could find.  Also, it does not come with the cheesecloth or rubberband as noted in some of the other reviews - not really a big deal since you can just use a papertowel to cover the bucha and rubberbands are easy to come by, but it was just one more annoyance with this already-overpriced purchase.",

They merely walk through my yard and don't stop to munch. I can now plan my spring garden with the expectation that I'll be able to enjoy my tulips.",

The Leaf Indoor Antenna perfectly fixed the problem and we now get over 40 channels. I followed the recommendation to tape up the antenna and check to see which channels it received. Moving it around (I actually moved it further down the wall) allowed me to find a place where I received all the channels I wanted before affixing to the wall. The install could not have been more simple and easy. Now, we get a lot of channels without loss of signal. I am very happy with this product. Looking at the other reviews, I think I should mention that I live in New York City, much more urban than other reviewers who were less satisfied.",

However, I really enjoy opening the door sometimes and letting fresh air into the house. Especially after a good fresh rain shower. I got tired of mosquito bites, so I decided to order this Magic Mesh Magnetic Screen Door. The fact that it is covered in butterflies was just icing on the cake for me. I absolutely love butterflies.<br /><br />The day my new Screen arrived, I had my hubby to hang it up. The screen is very simple to install. It comes with a package of velcro strips and a small box of tacs. I could have easily installed it myself if only I was taller. It only took my husband maybe 5 minutes or less to install. It looks gorgeous in my true opinion. I really love my new Screen. The butterflies just stand out so well. Several of my neighbors have complimented it just in the past few days.<br /><br />This Screen is made of good quality materials. The materials used to hang it are made good also. For the great price that the Screen is available for, this deal just can't be beat. Your not gonna get a good quality screen like this from anywhere else. I have tried other mesh screens in the past. None of them were made as well as this one. I am very pleased with it.<br /><br />* I received this Magic Mesh Magnetic Screen for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.",
