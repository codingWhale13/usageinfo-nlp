Occasionally, a purchase so completely blows you away that it leaves you almost speechless.  Almost!  I have now owned this thing for about 24 hours and if it gave me cancer, I would not like it any less.  I literally thought that I was being punked by Amazon.<br />Somebody should be up on charges!  Perhaps it was the utter lack of any resemblance of an assembly instruction and the fact that this sucker does not exactly come together in a heartbeat, or the missing pieces, or the relatively low light despite the 3000 watts, the fact that I was not the first owner since it came all scratched up in a beat up box.  The list of dislikes is long but to sum it all up, this is singularly the worst purchase that I have ever made and I am already packing it up to send back.  If you are looking for a low quality item that will literally drive you insane with rage, buy two because this one was designed for you!	2013-03-27

The reason I did not give it 4 or 5 stars is that the foam divider that comes in the case was mashed and it will not go back to its correct form, and there is a harder layer of foam at the top that is supposed to be glued to the bottom part, but it separated and I again was unable to get it to go back to the way it was supposed to be.  I bought customizable magic foam and it fit perfect.	2015-04-10
US	31930689	RB9V6LPVA7SOB	B003NCWPNC	750107081	First Alert DW-700 Digital Wireless Security Recording System with 7-Inch LCD Display	Camera	3	2	5	N	Y	First Alert DW-700, Simple - No Frills	This DW-700 system so far has been operating OK. Just remember it is wireless (more subject to interference, low range, low resolution, easily hacked). Purchase a wired system if you want better of the previous mentioned items.<br />  If you want to move the monitor to a different location, just unplug it from the 110v wall socket to another 110v socket, problem is you wont get as far away from the camera as the owner manual states.<br />  The monitor is very easy to pick up and watch hand held, but you wont be able to distinguish facial features, just able to know if the subject is two legged or four legged, not unless the subject is very very close to the camera.<br />  It is not a true statement entirely that you cannot see the infared light, and the camera is able to see in complete darkness. Yes, the camera can see in complete darkness and you can't, but  you can see the camera in the darkness because all the green and red l.e.d.'s emiting the infared are lighted up and you can see where the camera is.<br />  If you want to add another camera, (because of this systems limited range and the expense of that other camera) it would be wiser to buy another DW-700 system and program it's camera to a different location on it's monitor than the other one, this way you can separate the two cameras away from each other as far as you want as long as there is a 110v wall socket at that other location.<br />  Time will tell if this is a dependable product, but as its working now, I would highly recommend this system to anyone wanting an affordable (compared to other high priced units) very simple, very easy to set up and get running, and very simple to move to a different location.<br />  Bottom line, you can get a lot better system, at a lot greater price, with a lot more complications getting it up and running, and a lot less portability.	2013-04-04

Read it on your Smartphone?  Really now.	THINK TWICE ABOUT BUYING NIKON<br /><br />DON’T BUY ANY NIKON PRODUCT IF YOU WANT AN INSTRUCTION MANUAL<br />Because Nikon does not give you an instruction manual, at least not on some models.<br /><br />On 4/16/15 I bought model S6800 (another point and shoot similar to this model) only to find it came with a Quick Start booklet but NO COMPREHENSIVE PRINTED MANUAL. All you get is a link to a PDF.  So, you must learn and memorize the camera before you go out and take pictures OR take your laptop with you OR read the instructions on your Smartphone [paying for the cell time and data charges], OR print-out the PDF & carry its 250 pages on 250 sheets of 8-1/2 x 11 paper in your backpack.<br /><br />I called Customer Care asking them for a Printed manual.  After elevating the call twice, a manager gave me “corporatespeak” that Nikon has “gone green” - doing good for the environment by saving paper.  I was told that no printed manuals exist. It’s clear to me that they used to because the PDF page format is the same 5” x 5” page size of the Quick Start Guide.  I find it hard to believe that they wouldn’t have some around to make customers happy who ask for them. Wrong. I was told that they do not.  The “corporatespeak” was like a broken record; nothing in the conversations I had with three people at Nikon that gave any indication that they cared one iota about making me a happy customer.<br /><br />Getting nowhere, and recognizing that those to whom I had spoken were scripted in what they were to say, have no authority, and are trained to bar to the public’s access to executives who have authority, I asked for the name or at least the title and address of an executive to whom I could write a letter.  I was told that they were not allowed to give this information over the phone (not even the address?)  And that it was all available on the website.  I looked.  There is none; at least I found none after 25 minutes of searching.  It is clear that theydon’t want their senior executives to be contacted and they don’t care about any inconvenience to the customer. Talk about being out of touch with your market.<br	2015-08-28

It's only one of two ultra-wide zooms for Micro Four Thirds, and it is quite a bit less than the Lumix 7-14mm.  It's also smaller, lighter, and can be used with 52mm filters.  For a short time I had the Olympus 12mm prime and found that unless you are pixel peeping or printing out larger than 30x20, you won't notice a difference in detail.  So unless you need the wide aperture for low light, the 9-18mm is a great all-around ultra-wide lens.	2012-04-29

Its nearly perfect in every way. Very easy to use, produces stunning pictures - particularly when you plug it into the HDMI input of a large screen HDTV.  I can only pick 2 things that could be improved - it is a fingerprint magnet - a bit like the iPhone, and the Arc Soft Media Impression editing software supplied (in the camera)is very very basic. But when you consider what it costs, these two points fade into the background. Well done Kodak.	2009-09-25

I must say I am pleasantly surprised by the outcome. The lens produces quite good resolution, even if you crop the pictures significantly, it does not lose its sharpness. It does produce some image distorting (stretching at the edges) around 10mm, but I feel this adds to the beauty. The distortion is minor and not as much as a fisheye lens.    I bought this to use with my Nikon D60, and its has become my primary lens!	2009-03-02

There's no visible lubricant on the ring and hence no chances of getting any lubricant on the glass. The filter rotates smoothly and screws on easily if gently aligned with the lens threads.

I have been practicing yoga for about eight months now and this bag allows you to carry everything you need...and more! The bag itself is durable and built to last. You can carry it over your shoulder or as a crossbody, whichever you prefer. The outside has two large pockets and a place for your water bottle. Most bags I see only fit the small plastic bottles but I was able to fit my Nalgene in here which was impressive! The outside pockets could easily fit workout clothes, towels, a tablet, phone, keys, whatever you need to throw in there. The inside of the bag fits my full size yoga mat with room to spare. I definitely could have fit shoes, towels, or a change of clothes in there no problem. I love that this bag is big enough to fit what you need inside so you don't have to carry multiple bags. I would highly recommend this bag for my fellow yogis!	2015-04-03

Note that these are &#34;Beer Pong&#34; balls - not regulation ping pong balls. They are not going to work well in a ping pong game, and would be rejected in a tournament.

Just make a 1-inch cut and the guthook does the rest. The thumb grooves and ridges on the back of the blade make this knife comfortable to hold in any way you will need to when using it.  If you're looking for an affordable hunting knife that will get the job done, this is it.  Best of all with the fixed blade, this thing is very easy to clean.	2012-11-19

I installed this about a month ago and so far, so good.  Nothing major good/bad to report.<br /><br />The box was pretty beat-up through delivery, but for the size, I somewhat expected it that way.  None of the pieces/parts were damaged as they were packed well.<br /><br />Assembly was rather straight forward.  Just be warned that there are a few pictures where they updated the hardware but not the pictures.  The hardest part was actually installing the fully assembled backboard into the pole that was previously cemented.  They recommend 4 adults for the process  but we actually did it with three, but it was rather awkward.  Our yard has an instant grade upward off the drive, so that made it more difficult as there was no good place for ladders.<br /><br />As far as pieces/parts are concerned, I was missing the shock bellow.  Instead I received a plastic sleeve that fit over the shock but needed bored a bit to get the bolts through.  Nothing major but an FYI for others.<br /><br />Up/down maneuverability is tremendously simple.  I was surprised how easy the backboard adjusted up/down.	2015-06-27

I've owned this specific gun for awhile now, and it has come in handy in my friends VERY small basement. We both agreed only spring pistols when we played, otherwise we would have extremely massive welts. He used a tiny stub-nose and I had this beast. I won all 3 games. We had originally planned on playing 10 games but in the final game I shot him in his scrotum. He wasn't very pleased. There are a few flaws though - When I first got this, I tried shooting a few pellets to get used to it, and it jammed up quite quickly. It needs to be lubricated before even shooting. I was able to eventually get the BB out by heating up a skewer and stabbing the BB, waiting for the plastic to melt, and pull it out. All in all, it took 1 hour and 35 minutes. 1 hour and 34 minutes I didn't need to waste if I had just lubed it. Also, a few days ago the inner 'outer' barrel (the barrel that isn't silver and 6.00MM in diameter) randomly popped out. This is also what you see when you cock it, and there is a slide that pops back, as it does have an open ejection port. At first it looked cool, almost like a silencer, but when I shot it, I knew I had to get a new gun, because the BB's would sometimes hit the 'silencer' and spin off course, and lose a lot of speed. I went on to buy another because, along with a new gun, I would like a second magazine, so I may as well hit two birds with one stone. A final note about the magazine; It may rattle like a b****, but you can fix that by tightening the outer screws.    I doubt anyone read that whole review...	2010-02-10

Without wanting to know what it was supposed graded at the jeweler told me that this ring was poorly cut and that the color was more like a K or L and the clarity was no better than an I2 or I3.  He allowed me to look at this ring for myself to prove that he wasnt making false claims in hope i would purchase from him.

I was unsure what to expect because this item is such an old model, but it's in perfect condition and works. I did run into a bit of a stumbling block where as soon as I plugged it into my computer to sync, it froze and would not allow me to access anything, nor would my computer recognize that a device was plugged in. However I want to stress that this was NOT the fault of the seller in any way, I only mention it in case other people are looking to buy Zunes on Amazon and have this issue! I researched for awhile online and discovered it was an issue with the manufacturing and the original firmware. Every single Zune of this model dealt with the exact same problem back in 2008, and they had to set up emergency updates to fix it. Because the item was in near-new condition and contained one of the early versions of the firmware, this occurred for me yesterday. But again, it had nothing to do with the seller and I was able to find a resolution online after some research and tweaking of my device. I must say I'm very impressed to have an item from 2006 that is in such great condition and am syncing my music to it as I type this. Very satisfied and happy to replace my previous zune, which though it was a later model was not as sturdy and has a huge crack in the face! A good buy and a great price.	2013-04-25

I live in a suburb on the side of a 60 foot hill, close to the bottom of the valley. Using it on the ground floor I got stations 28 miles away and closer, depending on where I placed it. Windows definitely helped but I couldn't find an ideal spot to get all stations and one station I have to have is 30 miles away and apparently just out of range as I never got it? The antenna has about a 6 foot cord with it and I attached longer coax so I could move it around and just could not find a sweet spot on the ground floor.

"Let me preface this review:  I listened to Led Zep way too loud when I was young, so please keep in mind that my hearing isn't what it used to be.  Having said that, I rip music from my CD's at 256 bit rate so I only get ~500 songs on my 4gig iPod mini - the music quality is better than my ears can take it in.  Last year I ran the Denver marathon and couldn't have done it without my music.   <br /> <br />OK:  I bought these earbuds recently because they got great reviews and they sit inside your ears, so I thought they wouldn't fall out (I trained and ran the marathon with iPod earbuds + Griffen Earjams, which are fine.) <br /> <br />Well, these Sennheisers are so good I haven't been on the road with them yet.  At work they seal out everything, which might be bad for running on the road.  But the sound quality is so much over-the-top compared to my iPod earbuds that I would compare them equitably to my Sony MDR-V6 headphones (~$90).  I'm not an audiophile, but I love music of all kinds  and I will eventually wear these Sennheisers on long runs where I'll sweat all over them and eventually ruin them - for now though, I'm just enjoying them at work and home.  I got mine about $70. <br /> <br />Also, I'm no fan of the shorter left ear cord, but I'm willing to give it a chance.  And there *is* a \\""bustle in your hedgerow\\"" noise from the cord as you brush against it - now I know what everyone else is talking about with respect to in-ear earbud cord noise.  In my opinion it's not that all big a deal and I'm sure I'll learn to attenuate it out once I start running with these babies.  I never thought my iPod could sound so good, and now it's a little painful to go back to the stock Apple earbuds when I go running. <br /> <br />They're a bit pricey for the way I intend to use them, but they stay put and sound really great.  They pumped brand new life into my trusty old iPod (which I've broken down and replaced parts on, I don't know how many"	2007-05-06

The headband broke the first time after about 4 months of regular use. Mailed them back and Beyer repaired them for free. However, they just snapped again three months later. I'm totally convinced this is a design flaw, because they broke at the same location both times, and the plastic is quite thin at that part of the headband. I've emailed Beyer to see if they'll give me a credit toward a different model, but I'm not optimistic. It's a bummer, because the sound and comfort of the DTX 350p was very good.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />Pros: Lightweight, comfortable enough to wear for several hours with occasional adjustments, very little microphonics, good sound at low to mid volume<br />Cons: Sound balance becomes harsher at higher volumes, short cable, very little isolation<br /><br />Design/Build Quality (Good): These headphones look great. I love the minimal, all-black design. The logos are small and not in your face. The plastic frame is lightweight, but doesn't feel flimsy. The build feels fairly solid overall. Headband adjusts easily and has a thin metal support band inside. All the hinges and swivels feel solid, not loose or creaky. I like the flat &#34;no-twist&#34; cables, although a single-ear connection point would have been better. There are almost no microphonics when the cable brushes against my clothing, which is good. However, the cable length is too short, imo. I bought an extension to use these with my desktop (which sits on the floor beneath my desk). If you're using these with a phone or DAP, you'll be fine.<br /><br />Comfort (Very Good): They felt a tad snug out of the box, but I stretched them overnight, and they now feel pretty close to perfect. The clamping force is not overbearing, yet they feel stable on my head. The earcups are a good size and provide a good amount of padding. The apex of the headband is also nicely padded. I can wear these for six or more hours sitting at my desk without any problems, and I have a fairly large head. The swivels ensure that the cups rest flatly against the ears.<br /><br />Sound (Pretty Good): I'm not a hardcore audiophile, so I can't go into tremendous depth on the nuances here, but I'll do my best.	2014-12-30

It dosn't generate playlists like other mp3 players Ive owned. But it does appear to support folders, So I have 4 activies Boxing,Biking,Dancing,Weightlifting, all have different music for the activities, and I can change folder by a button. Shuffle appears to stay in the folder and not shuffling all 4 folders like most mp3 players. It does support playlists but on OSX you will need to make them yourself. I think I tried to do it with VLC, but I can't tell if the select folder or playlists is working, the same select button does both. Either way it works, just not clear which is working. Its great being cordless for activity, I can't tell you how many times the cord has got in the way of boxing, weightlifting, dancing, so its worth every penny for those activities, the water resistant feature will ensure it won't die the first 90 degree day im biking 20 miles, (I hope) I haven't tried that yet with it, but so far its surviving brutal sweaty elliptical sessions and dancing. So far so good, It is weaker then other mp3 players, not as loud, if you want loud music especially for dancing this could be a little weak. They are pretty chunky I was expecting it to be like my Bluetooth headset size, they are alot thicker and heavier. I have a very big head also so it stays pretty snug, but smaller heads that don't like earbuds this might not stay in your ears nice. Overall im pleased, wish it was louder and had normal pads but love everything else. I hope it survives this summer	2015-01-20

All I know is that this tv is well above my expectations the quality of the picture is crystal clear, video games look amazing also I have no idea why people don't put there opinion of input lag in there reviews for tv's apparently not a lot of people play them that post well anyways the input lag on this tv is not bad at all if your use to a tube tv that has absolutely no lag at all then you will notice a slight change but this change will not effect your game play I play lots of first person shooters it took me about a day to get use to it. The sound quality is very good considering how thin the tv is, when watching movies the big action scenes will not be given justice for sound quality but for games its pretty decent, i also use a turtle beach head set so its much better on those. If you want good quality sound a sound system would be good to get. Also the black light I've seen some reviews where people were complaining about it showing through it only shows through on the corners and only on very black screens such as widescreen movies or game loading screens. It is not enough to be a problem personally i think it looks pretty cool, unless you are very picky it shouldn't be a problem. So all in all this tv is a definite steal for the price I would definitely recommend buying this tv, and for someone such as my self that uses it constantly i would have to say very very happy with this buy.	2011-04-07

I had heard great things about Wedgits for ages and had seen them a couple times in real life, but didn't get the hype. Then I saw one of the idea books (showing how to make some of the sculptures) and it clicked. This is a really cool 3D puzzle, that is also an open-ended construction toy! The pieces lock together, which is how you can make something like a dog that stands up on its own. I will say that the locking/unlocking process has a small learning curve, but I think it's worth  sticking with since this product allows kids to create in a way that is simply not possible with traditional blocks or even lego-type building bricks. GREAT learning toy, and the translucent feature is great if you have jumped on the light table/light panel bandwagon (we got sucked in, it's a lot of fun!)	2014-01-01

Your “helper” will love the “Lanard Workman Ultimate Workbench” and the tools included with it.  Although the description states this toy has more than 72 pieces, that number includes all the components of the workbench.<br /><br />The many tools resemble those that Daddy or Papa may use and will allow your little one to feel more “grown-up”.  Because they are hard plastic, there is minimal danger of anyone getting hurt.  Additionally, parents/grandparents need not worry about damage to walls, furniture, or other items a child tries to “repair”.  These tools and accessories include: an open-end wrench and a closed-end wrench, a chisel with interchangeable flat and curved blades, a screwdriver with an interchangeable flat-head and a Phillips head, a handsaw, pliers, a measuring stick, a hammer, a “motorized” grinder and lathe, a bench-mount vise grip, a nail gun that makes a popping sound and a flashing light when the trigger is pushed, four hooks for hanging tools on the workbench back, an angled open-end/box-end wrench, and 32 nuts and bolts.  The one major tool that was not included was a drill with drill bits.<br /><br />The workbench portion of this toy is easy to assemble.  A pictorial guide shows how to fit the pieces together; it would have been helpful if the directions had also been written out.  The footprint of the workbench is approximately 15” deep X 22” wide.  The tabletop height is about 21”; the back adds about 15” more to the height of the unit.  A well, centered on the workbench’s surface, in the front is useful for holding the nuts and bolts.<br /><br />All pieces of the “Lanard Workman Ultimate Workbench”, except the placards for the back, are made of hard plastic.  Unless your child/grandchild regularly and repeatedly throws toys onto a hard surface, durability should not be an issue.  Each of the components is finished so there are no sharp or rough edges to damage tender skin.<br /><br />Targeted at children between the ages of three and six, the “Lanard Workman Ultimate Workbench” will hold the greatest appeal for those at the lower end of the group.  By the age of five, children may play with this toy a few times but will likely become bored with it since they recognize that the tools are not “real”.  Most five-year old children think	2015-03-07

The ball is easy to inflate and I like the handle to carry it around as well. She actually carries it around like a purse! The ball itself is made of a thick material and seems durable.<br /><br />However, I'm very disappointed that when it arrived, there was an oily substance on it and after a while the graphics of the princesses rub off! Also, it loses air quickly and you have to keep pumping it up.

We’ve purchased good quality Radio Flyer items in the past and been very happy with them, so we were looking forward to giving this new trike a try.<br /><br />It took my husband and I about 20 minutes to assemble which went fairly smoothly – as long as you take your time and read the directions carefully it’s not difficult.  Depending on the age of the child(ren) using the trike may affect what parts you want to have attached to the trike. For younger children there is a three-point safety harness with an adjustable seat, a wrap-around trap with cup-holder and even little bars to rest little feet that have not learned how to pedal yet.  The manufacturer’s recommended age range is 9 months to 5 years old – this can vary depending on the size and abilities of your child.<br /><br />The removable canopy is a wonderful bonus – I wish all trikes had this as a feature.  The parent steering bar is adjustable which is perfect for someone who is shorter like me, or taller like my husband – we can each adjust it a bit to make it more comfortable to use.<br /><br />Two things that I think they could make better: rubber tires instead of plastic ones would make this quieter and provide some traction.  Plastic wheels can easily slide or lose traction on wet surfaces or things like grass or accumulated leaves.  Also we found this rather easy to tip because it’s so tall – never leave little ones unattended with this for their safety and your peace of mind.<br /><br />This comes with a 1 year warranty but we’ve never had any issues with Radio Flyer items (bikes, wagons, scooters) breaking and they’ve all lived long past the warranty period.	2014-02-10

She is my first baby girl after having her two older brothers, so getting to have pink is still pretty exciting for me!  I loved this kitchen set because of its soft baby pink color and that it was wooden.  I helped my husband put it together and it took about 45 minutes.  It wasn't difficult at all.  It was even prettier in person than it was in the pictures online. I baught a stainless steel cooking set and the pastel kidkraft plates, cups, and bowls to go with it. She plays with it every day opening and shutting the doors, dragging her cookware out, and pretending to cook and wash dishes.	2012-01-19

I ordered these because I've always been a big propenent of using separate cutting boards for various foods in order to avoid cross contamination. That being said, sometimes the boards would get mixed up (I've always bought the cheap white plastic kind) or they'd end up with these huge grooves that have been cut into them from so much use and it seems like they never really get 100% clean. Not to mention, I love that these are flexible! There have been so many times I ended up accidentally scraping pieces of food into the burner on the stove instead of the pot or pan because of a big awkward cutting board. With these it's simple and safe because you can even hold further back on the board when you fold it to avoid any splashing onto your hands. Very highly recommend!	2013-02-25

Chances are this set of cookware is destined for kitchen ornamentation only.  So, if ever I need to feel superior yet concede to allowing my sniping, snooping and  snobbish relatives  in the house again, I can taunt my perpetually prying aunt by showing her I did in fact end up with a fine set of pots to...cook in.<br /><br />Conversely, I do feel a little foolish after thinking about all the hours I spent a few years ago trying to decide between Anolon or Circulon anodized cookware, eventually choosing the [[ASIN:B000069LBA Circulon 80087 2 10-Piece Cookware Set]], meticulously caring for and hanging each piece only to have it now relegated to the dark, dank and dent dangerous netherworld of the kitchen cabinets along with all the other less worthy skillets and more.  This set may not be Mauviel but I don't have any aspirations to polish copper or can I cost justify the stainless steel when a set like this Anolon collection is available.<br /><br />After the traumatic lemon juice/baking soda cleaning era of my teens where I served as an indentured servant to a group of copper bottomed Revere ware pans, I swore stainless steel and copper would never see the light of day in my realm. You can imagine my glee when I discovered this set has a copper core but a stainless base so my former chattel status to the copper cleanser will not be revisited. Yet, I still harbored reservations about subjecting my shiny new skillets to the ravages of the gas flame, even at nothing more intense than the recommended medium setting. To my surprise and relief, these pans performed so admirably I almost considered making them the journeymen of daily duty...almost.<br /><br />In terms of heat distribution I found them superior to the non-stick Circulon pans I have so appreciated up to now.  I am aware of the ways (getting cooking oils up to temperature  being a big one) to minimize sticking when using stainless pans and clean up wasn't a major undertaking either, including splatter areas around the riveted handles.  While I did notice the metal handles conducted much more heat than the synthetic handles of the Circulon set, it was still comfortable to grip them without use of a pot holder.  Additionally, Circulon2 might withstand oven temperatures up to 350 degrees but this set	2012-01-29

The B&D was able to accomodate a 9x13&#34; pan, whereas this unit will not even accomodate my 7x11&#34; pan. The B&D had a 90 minute timer (as opposed to the 60 minute timer on this model), it was well insulated (no insulation on this model), had a separate toast function (this unit has a separate toast setting, but still uses the timer, which generally results in under or overdone toast), the thermostat on the B&D was generally reliable (this one is hit or miss), and the B&D heated evenly (this unit has hot spots that result in blackening of food in some areas). I guess it was worth the $20 (I paid $35 for the B&D 15 years ago), but I wouldn't buy it again.	2013-02-06

That's equivalent to paying roughly $2.75 for a 12-pack of cans, or $2 for a 6-pack of 16.9 oz bottles -- prices that I see very rarely at the grocery stores.  Since the 2-liters are usually cheaper, that's usually what I want to buy. Or it would be, if they didn't lose their fizz as soon as you opened them. Thankfully, fizz-keepers to the rescue! Do they keep the last sip from your 2-liter exactly as fizzy as the first? No. Do they make it so that you can enjoy (actually enjoy) a 2-liter over a week rather than having to drink it all in one sitting? Yes. And for that, to me, they're totally worth it.  I'll generally agree with everyone else that these don't last forever. I still have 3 working pumps of this variety (3 months of use), but of the three rubber-top type ones that I've had, one was a dud out of the package, one failed within a month, and the third is only working because of some teflon tape I used to seal its leaks. I don't expect the three of this kind to last forever either, but it's pretty easy to just buy new ones.  I think this kind is better than the rubber-top kind both because they seem to last longer and because it's easier to fit the 2-liter in smaller spaces in the fridge. You do need to be careful not to over-pump the bottle though, because as people have noted, this kind can and will fly off if there's too much pressure (not so with the rubber-top kind). Just make sure to pump until the bottle is somewhat firm but not hard -- for me, that's usually 10-15 pumps for a bottle 1/2 to 1/3 full, or 20-30 pumps for a bottle that's mostly gone. ---- **EDIT August 2016** It's been over two years since I got these. I have two of the three left, and the only reason I'm missing one is because the dog chewed it up. This version is DEFINITELY superior to the rubber bulb-top versions, and I will happily buy more of these whenever my original set finally bites the dust.	2014-06-21

Lasts for many years.	"Got this to replace a T-Fal pan I had used for 7 years. It still had most of the non stick surface intact but was not really smooth enough anymore. This professional model seems to be even better, so let's see. Get the 12\\"" version. I prefer a large pan even when cooking smaller amounts of food as you have more space to move stuff around, plus splatter to the range is minimized."	2013-07-03

The design is exactly the same now as the one I have.  Love the way everything slips together neatly and SAFELY into a compact little bundle.  I am a vegan and use this mandolin at least 3 times a week.<br /><br />I happened to see this item and write a review while stopping on Amazon to buy some mandolin gloves.  The older I get, the more I err on the side of safety.  This mandolin is razor sharp ~ which is why it works so well.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed !!	2015-05-05

This poor percolator does the job but it is not made as quality as those we had in the past. It says \\""stainless steel\\"" but the only parts that refers to are the basket and stem. The strangest thing about it is that the handle was installed upside down!  Twelve cups is at the bottom of the clear guage, making the guage useless. I purchased it several months ago as a backup in case our other West Bend died of old age, so I only now discovered the mistake. In a way I think this peculiar percolator belongs in our strange family. We still recommend this particular model, just check it over carefully when it arrives."	2011-10-02

Enter the Campbell's Slow Cooker Sauce. It will Moroccanize that chicken in 6 to 8 hours of neglect. When I first opened the pouch the smell was decidedly processed and made me wonder if I had wasted my couple of bucks. But when I opened that crockpot seven hours later, it smelled sooo good. This made the kind of chicken that will have you relishing your burps later in the evening. The instructions on the back recommend skinless boneless chicken, but I used skin on and bone in because it makes a more flavorful stew. Plus half the appeal of Moroccan chicken is in what that spice blend does to the skin, and such was the case here. Taking the bones out is a minor aggravation. Someone accidentally picked up Quinoa instead of cous cous to go with this, but it turned out to be a good pairing because the chewiness of the Quinoa against the tenderness of the stew worked out very well.	2014-01-21

I think that this Tea is not meant for regular<br />everyday consumption, but rather the stuff you bring out for special occasions and what not.<br />I did enjoy it, I just personally can't afford it with the way me and my hubby love to drink tea.	2014-01-30

Lenny was (with emphasis on the was) supposed to be a durability scale of 9 (out of 10).  He did last longer than the Lion - with a durability rating of 7 - but the lion lasted less than 10 minutes before the stuffing and squeaker was being pulled out.  Lenny lasted longer, about 10 hours total time, with maybe an hour of serious attack time.  His ears were gone within 10 minutes, and by the morning of day two, he too was having the stuffing pulled out.  Maybe the unstuffed toys from VIP will last longer.  Our dog uses her front teeth to pull at the fabric until she can create a tear. She did enjoy it - so that's why it got a \\""3\\"", but we have to find something else, she manages to extract every bit of stuffing from these stuffed animals.  Lenny ended up inside out!  Oh well.  Maybe they will want to test a tougher stuffed animal with her.  The videos with the \\""tough\\"" zoo animals just don't compare to the devastation a 2 year old golden retriever can do!"	2010-12-13

I love my Charcoal grill, but couldn't seem to get the hang of getting the hardwood coals to light quickly and burn evenly in my chimney.  It always took a few attempts with wadded up newspaper to get it going, and little bits of burned up newspaper ended up all over the place.    So I ordered some of these lighter cubes hoping they'd work as well as they (and reviews) say they would.  To say I wasn't disappointed is an understatement.  I put three cubes under my chimney, lit them and walked away.  I came back a couple of minutes later (when I normally had to stuff/light another batch of newspaper) and was shocked at how evenly the coals were burning and how hot they were already.  After about 15 minutes, I had a chimney full of the hottest coals I'd ever seen.    These are well worth the money based on the simplicity alone.  But add the faster, hotter, and more evenly burning coals and these cubes are a home run.	2011-08-18

I've planted 7 seeds so far, and 5 have germinated.    Because they took 2 weeks to come from China, I soaked them 48 hours in a quart of spring water with a ¼ tsp of hydrogen peroxide.    I put them with the brown spot (top) on the side in 3in peat pots with peat seed starting mix and covered with saran wrap and then square plastic plates to give them some darkness and then put them under my fluorescent lights for some warmth.  The peat pots are in a tray without holes.    I squirted them with water twice a day as needed as the saran wrap leaves plenty of air to breathe out the sides and it is extremely dry where I live in the winter.  Germination took about 2 weeks.    As they get bigger, I will put pebbles in the tray beneath so they are never standing in water.    I am growing Clivias to improve the air indoors during the winter and other seasons as I have many of my windows covered with blankets like an earthship to save on heating and cooling costs.

Everything looked fine as far as no leaks from the connected PVC pipe. Then I noticed water coming from the pump.  The leak was where the electric motor connects to the pump. Was really flowing out  Repacked  it in its same box. (which was cut up bad) and send it back.  Now I have to wait another week or more to have my pool filtered again.  The motor was very quiet, and the flow from the pump was much greater then my old pump.  Will have to wait awhile to give a review on the new pump.  It's a shame that I put  out over $350 for the pump, and find out it is faulty..  Hope the replacement will work out..<br /><br />UPDATE  UPS  picked up the pump the next day.  I received an email that the new pump should arrive by July 8th.  I emailed Amazon and asked why it would take so long.  They told me because it was \\""free shipping\\"", it would take up to 7 days. Then they told me that they would update the shipping to one day. (at no charge)  That was on a Saturday.  I received the pump on Monday. Re-installed and checked for leaks.  \\""NO LEAKS\\""  I'm sure they put a pressure test on it before it left the warehouse, because I could see some drops of water in the bowl. It's quiet and really pumps the water through my Pentair Quad DE filter.  Very happy with the replacement, and of course Amazon for all there help."	2013-06-26

These blocks are extremely sturdy but the covers do have a tendency to fly out when very strong winds passed by. Below I have listed a few things I have done to make this product in my mind, the best solution I have tried.<br /><br />I do not use water. I use gravel or rocks that I bought lowes. Yes, it is more expensive, it cost me about an additional $50. But the blocks are sturdier heavier and a lot easier to work with than when using water.<br /><br />Regarding the cover blowing off, just use some tape. I used gorilla tape on one of the long side. And it did the trick for me.<br /><br />Bottom line these are way better than the water bags and they are great if the use gravel instead of water. The only reason I rated it four stars instead of five was because when the covers do blow off they can very easily get cracked.	2013-11-13

This flag was advertised as having a 7' pole and when it arrived (and on packing slip) it was 8'.  Since I had ordered a 7' American flag and intended to use them together I had to cut the pole off.  The little leather like loop at the top was torn in half by your machine needle passing over it and I had to try to piece it back together with a needle and thread to make it hold.  Then, when I put sand in the base, the little thin plug provided just punched right down into the base and had to use needle nose pliars to try to retrieve it.  When I finally did get it back out,  I placed it over the hole and taped over all that with duct tape  If we hadn't needed the flag right away, I would have packed it up and returned it rather than go through such a hassle.  The flag itself was fine.	2015-06-07

This is not a lightweight nylon poncho that you'll find at hiking stores for twice the cost, so if you're counting every ounce then it's not the way to go.  But it also won't leach water in heavy rain like those plastic bag thin ponchos do.  Yellow side is handy in case of needing an emergency signal, although some of the coloring initially rubs off on your clothes.  Recommend using yellow on the outside to start with.

I have been burned by so many \\""TV' products. I'd get sucked in by the commercials making the product look so easy to use, only to find it's either complicated, or very easy but doesn't really work as claimed.<br /><br />So I was really reluctant to spend the money on these... but I'm all about comfort and style... and the commercials made these look so comfy, yet stylish. It took me a while, but it finally sucked me in and I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />I'll tell you this... I plan on buying myself another pair and buy a few pairs as Christmas gifts for family and friends. That's how happy I am with this product. Which surprised me. I can add these to a very small list of Made for TV items that actually work as they promise!<br /><br />The inside is very soft, and warm... but outside they look stylish and slimming just like my favorite pair of skinny jeans. They are holding up well, even after several washings so far. It's just nice to have something stylish that you can move and bend in comfortably.<br /><br />My skinny jeans are always tight in the waist and leave marks on my stomach, and when you bend, they get tight at the knees... I also hate how rough denim feels. I've never liked the texture of denim. So to have the denim look, with the softness of pajamas, amazing! I like the flared leg... and I like the length. I'm really happy with this purchase.<br /><br />My favorite summer outfit usually includes my favorite demim skort. (It looks like a jean skirt from front to back, but underneath the skirt are sewn in shorts.) But like jeans, they are uncomfortable, especially in the waist, so my dream would be for them to come up with a pair of pajama skorts. all the style of a denim skort, but the comfort of pajama shorts. lol."	2011-09-22

But I gotta warn you, the solid black portion is made out of the same silken material that they make some sleep gowns- it's stretchy, mostly matte, but thin. Don't get me wrong, I don't think that makes it a sleep gown, in fact I don't think most people would be able to identify the material while its on you (unless they're UP on you, in which case I doubt they are there to be feeling your dress' material), and as a bonus it make it even more comfortable than most other dresses. But the warning here it, don't wear something that will give you visible lines, as this wont hide them, and don't but it too tight. The sizing is on spot, I'm a medium/ 6-10 (I vary depending on the brand) and I bought an 8, and it fits like a charm. The mesh is sturdy enough for mesh. I don't expect this will withstand me doing tactical maneuvers through bushes, but I'm not buying it for that, plus at this price you can buy a backup!	2014-05-15

I got my first ones with the 4oz bottles in a set I got for my shower. We tried it with my baby during her 1st months and she actually liked the nipple thought at first it seems the 1 hole flows fast thank she could take but eventually, she caught up with it. She's still using this nipple until now that she's 4 months old since the 2 holes seems to fast for her still. We bought two packs of this to use for our other avent bottles and they all go through sterilization daily and each nipple gets used around 3 times a day. And after 4 months of use and sterilization, they still look like new. So i'm really impressed with the quality. I like that its has engraved markings too on two sides of the nipple so its easier to see the number so i don't confuse it with the other 2 hole nipples i've got. I've had my baby try other nipples and bottles and avent bottles and nipples has been her favorite.	2012-05-01

We have had great experiences with this crib, and even better experience with Guava Family's customer service. They've been super generous with e-mail help and answering questions, answering all of our nit-picky questions about the materials and always responding very quickly. Also, they've never hesitated with replacements (our mattress got a little rip in the side after a few months of use) or exchanges. It's more expensive than some other options, but the safety of the materials, the overall design, and our overall experience with Guava more than made it worth it for us.<br /><br />The crib itself is great, and our son has been sleeping in it as his main crib for the last few months, since we've moved overseas. He loves it, and he also enjoys playing in there during the day. The zipper opening is a great feature. It's big enough that one of us can easily sit in there with him, which is really nice, too.<br /><br />Our only slight suggestion for improvement would be to make the sheets a  bit easier to install. Getting the velcro through the little holes can be a pain, and the mattress sometimes doesn't lay flat until someone is on top of it. That's minor, though, and the organic cotton sheet that we later bought fits better and is easier to get the mattress flat under. It is also a bit more than the regular sheets, but we'd recommend it if you're able, because it feels nicer and seems to fit better.<br /><br />Definitely recommend Guava products.	2015-02-16

Enter Bamboo. Bottom line- bamboo is a silky and cool fabric, but it's been my experience that it is not as good for swaddling because it is silky and therefore easier to escape from. My child is a Houdini. I've used 4 different types of swaddlers (halo sleep sack, summer infant, swaddle me, Aden + Anais muslin and bamboo blankets). The miracle blanket has hands-down been the best. I chose to order the bamboo instead of the standard cotton fabric because my infant overheats easily. Plus, I am a sucker for anything environmentally conscious. Here is the thing: buy the miracle blanket. Buy the one in bamboo if you 1) have a hot-natured baby 2) want an organic option 3) are obsessed with the feel of bamboo (I am!) if you need/want a swaddle option that is nearly Houdini-proof you might want to go cotton. However, as I mentioned before, my child can escape anything and I have learned to make this bamboo one work. The secret is wrapping the longest piece of fabric tighter than you think you need to.	2013-08-29

I was quite excited to find this backpack for the low price I got it for. I bought this back in June for the purpose of carting around my laptop. I don't carry much else in it (a bag with some charging cables and a couple USB drives, a notebook, and my external drive), and most of the time that trip is only from my bedroom downstairs to the living room. In the short time I've had the bag, several tears have already developed, the most recent one being at the outside of the left strap. I'm worried that this bag won't last much longer at this rate and that means I have to scramble to find another bag. Very disappointed.	2014-10-11

Purchased in September and put on around 270 miles on it in 3 months. Bought my second road bike (Giant Defy 2) in December, I outgrew this bike pretty quickly.<br />First be ready to dish out additional 50-70$ to get everything tuned to able to shift through all the gears w/o wearing down the chain & front derailleur (grinding noise when you ride). Brakes on this bike virtually none existent. Replacement is around 20-30$.<br /><br />If you are serious about spending 300$+ (with the added cost I have listed above) on a road bike go out and invest in a better option!	2014-02-02

The installation took about 3 hours as I expected.  The pulley system works well and is easy for anyone to operate.  I did have to buy some longer screws at the hardware store so that I could use the center holes for attaching to the joists instead of the two outer sets for the screws that they provided. Great price for a product that works.  It was really my only good option for my tall but narrow garage.	2013-09-29

I also loved the fact that the looks of this pak is very outdoory without being all that flashy or futuristic, or rather being camo or horribly colored.

I purchaed one at Napali Kayaks in Kaua'i in 2011 thinking I was just getting a souvenir. I had no idea that it would turn out to be my favorite performance shirt for the next several years. I've used it very hard for running and cycling on cool days for over two years and the shirt hasn't shown any signs of wear and tear. It's been drenched in sweat countless times and I've even fallen while wearing it trail running and still no tears and no signs of it falling apart. This shirt is also good for days when you leave and it's chilly, but becomes warmer as the sun comes up. It will keep the chill off your skin, but is breathable and won't cause you to overheat as the day warms up. I recently ran the Grand Canyon in the shirt. It was 19 deg. when we left in the AM and in the 80's as we climbed up the South Rim. The shirt was perfect for both situations. I agree with previous posts that the sizing is a bit small. I'm 6', 170lbs and usually wear a medium, but I have a large in this shirt and it fits perfectly. Slightly loose, but not at all baggy.	2013-12-04

I have a 2007 Chevy Malibu and a 2007 Impala. This fob worked perfectly for the 2007 Malibu but would not fit the 2007 Impala. The two original fobs looked identical but after closer inspection the Impala key fob electronics were a little bit larger and wouldn't fit in the case. The Malibu Key fob had the correct part # on the back as is shown in the pictures. The original impala key fob #s were faded and hard to read but 15912860 is the # I need to find. I will continue to investigate, if I find an answer I'll re-post.<br />I couldn't find the key fob for my 2007 Impala on Amazon but I did find it on ebay.	2014-02-17

This unit worked like a charm. The battery was down to 8 volts/15%. The SC-1200a properly began to charge, then desulfate, and slowly was able to get the battery back to 98% before I removed it to start the car. This took approximately 17 hours (700 CCA Battery), which isn't bad for a dead/sulfated battery using a charger costing less than $50. The plus is you can use it to maintain your battery on a vehicle you do not drive much. Keeping your battery charged above 98% can greatly extend the life. How long it will the charger last running 24/7? ...I do not know yet. I have only had it maintaining the battery for 3 weeks, but still no problems. It does have a cooling fan which probably should be cleaned/vacuumed occaisionally; and I've never felt the unit being hot to touch. Not sure what problem the first reveiwer had, or if the unit he had was defective or dropped before he purchased it. For a $50 charger which maintains and also desulfates a battery, you cannot beat it.	2010-03-09

The range is very impressive and you can comfortably sit some distance from the base and get excellent sound quality. The battery life is also very long for me.      In short, a very nice surprise.

The velcro enclosure is secure, and the magnetic closure on the flap works just fine to keep the cover closed.  I don't have the keyboard dock (yet), but there are openings in the leather for the supports.  I'm not sure how well it will work to keep the case on it and attach it to the dock.  It is easy to use the table with the cover folded back, and the tab allows you to stand it up or lay it about 30 degrees from horizontal, which is a great position for typing.  Now for a couple of (minor) cons.  These aren't really defects so much as comments on how the case is made, in case any of these things really matter to you:  When I got it, it had the powerful chemical smell that other reviewers have commented on.  I hung it on a coat hanger and left it outside for two days to air out, and then it only had a slightly noticeable smell if you put your nose right up to it.  Now (about a week later), it just smells like leather.  It's hard to press the power and volume buttons, but this because of the way the tablet curves on the edge (the buttons are between being on the side and the back.  Any case that adequately protects the sides will probably have a similar issue.  You can only use the case as a stand in the landscape orientation.  In the portrait orientation, it is too front heavy and tips over.  Because the \\""bottom\\"" of the tablet is on the hinge side, you have to have the cover open to insert the charger.  It would be very convenient if there were a small hole in the case to expose the charging/dock connector with the tablet closed."	2012-01-19

I based this purchase on reviews from cnet and other tech websites.  I was specifically looking for an external hard drive that would not die if dropped a short distance.  I got this 11/13/09.  As of today, the hard drive has been dead for 1 week.  It won't connect to my pc.  I plug it in, the white light comes on, and there is no hard drive listed on my computer.  The top of the case is glued on.  There are no rivets or screws, so when the unit heats up the top comes off.  My biggest issue is with customer service.  There is no phone number listed for in warranty items.  There are phone numbers for sales.  Unbeknownst to me, from what I can tell, actual phone support costs extra, and there is no data recovery.  I'm going to try to chat with someone tomorrow, but I have to fax in my receipt first.  I already registered the item, so what is the problem?  I will update with more info, but am not optimistic.  This is the second hard drive I've lost due to dropping.  From now on, I'm going to get an online backup or invest in some flash drives.    1/31/10--I chatted online with a service rep.  This is where a phone would have been useful.  I would plug the drive in and it would make a grinding sound.  Iomega wanted to send me a new usb cord, but I asked for a new/refurbished drive.  There were 2 basic options--send the drive in at my own cost, and get a new one back, or pay $25 to talk to a phone rep--Iomega would send me a new drive, and I would send the old one back in the new one's box.  Credit cards cannot be processed over the internet, only over the phone, which is why you have to pay $25 to talk to someone.  Funny, since I seem to be able to put my card number in  many websites and get what I need without talking to anyone...  I send the drive  and got a new one.  We'll see how long this one lasts.

Both routers were refurbished and have both been very stable and reliable with not problems whatsoever.  I highly recommend Linksys as a wireless network brand, my other router and cable modem are all Linksys and work great.	2010-09-10

The Magic Mouse from Apple has to be the most beautiful piece of device/gadget I have ever seen and  owned period.  The design of most mice today is so ergonomically driven in return yields designs that are not so aesthetically pleasing.  The Magic Mouse is different.  It seems as Jonathan Ive has totally neglected about ergonomics.  He just went ahead with sculpting a form to make the most beautiful device ever.  I have to admit, it took me two days to get used to the device, and at one point I even thought of switching back to the old Mighty Mouse or a Logitech Mouse.  But then I decided to continue using the Magic Mouse for a few more days.  To my surprise, I've gotten used to it, and grow to like how my hand hover over it effortlessly.  To those who thinks the Magic Mouse is uncomfortable, give it a few more days.  Trust me you'll find that this is not only the most beautiful device, it is quite comfortable once your hand readjust to it.	2009-11-05

The special offers (ads) don't bother me, not worth the money to not have them in my option, but what does bother me is the 16GB.  It has already filled up fast and I barely got it. Also, the lack of support for the Google Play store is a major issue for some of us.

It does not have plug in play, but I think that's because it's too small to have that plug and play feature. You'll have to install the drivers with the given CD or download it on IOGear's product support page. The range isn't high, but that could also be an issue of other bluetooth devices connecting to it. However, I suspect that my ASUS Black Diamond Dual-Band USB WiFi adapter is interferring with it. When I plug it in the area of my computer where the ASUS is also plugged in, the audio cuts off randomly. When I placed the bluetooth adapter on a USB hub that is closer to me and further from the WiFi adapter, it works without any interruption.	2013-02-25

This made all the difference in the world on a futon that our son slept on over winter break!  His bed is at college so I scrambled to find something for his 6 week stay and while the futon was comfortable (bought an innerspring mattress for that) it needed a little help.  This was the ticket and everyone who has slept on that bed says it is the best they've ever slept on.  After my water bed got a hole in it, I needed a soft place to sleep while I was trying to adjust to a traditional mattress again and this was my soft escape that saved me from the night sweats of our new euro plush top mattress.  This is cool and comfortable!!!  I can't keep the dogs off this bed now!!!!	2014-05-01

I live in Manhattan and am on a lower floor of an apartment building.  I get a lot of black residue that manages to get in even when my windows are closed -- this was always picked up by my other air cleaners.  In a nutshell, it is extremely easy to see/smell/experience when an air cleaning product is working in my apartment.      Someone broke one of two air cleaners that I owned and I was getting this as a replacement. At the end of this week's run of using the LightAir IonFlow 50C, I moved my other remaining air purifier back into my room and could get results I was used to.  The thing is, I need two -- one for the bedroom and one for the living room/dining room area, so I am back to searching.    Almost none of the pictures you see for this product on Amazon for this product match what it looks like; it wasn't a big deal since one of them did actually match -- the rest are pictures of another product by the same company.    Some pros:  it was quite easy to set up.  I had it up and going within 10 minutes -- most of that time was spent ensuring I met the placement criteria.    Cons:      again, I didn't see any effect at all.             this air cleaner has to be at least three feet from any wall, at least two feet from the ceiling and, ideally, should be even farther away from electronics (I didn't pay too much attention to this measurement since it wasn't relevant in my bedroom).           not exactly a \\""con,\\"" per se, more of a heads up, they mention that the electrical shock you get from touching the cleaner is extremely mild.  It was really jarring for me to touch it.  Not a deal-breaker, especially since I just had to unplug it to be able to touch the actual body of the appliance."	2009-07-18

I was looking for something to use for eBay, to showcase clothing. The clothing I was interested in selling was sized from S - XL. Most of the clothing was sized 8-10, and was actually too big for this mannequin but that was no problem, as it is standard practice on eBay to use clothespins to cinch clothing to accentuate details for photos.<br /><br />I sold approximately 150 pieces of clothing using this mannequin, and it has held up perfectly. I also decided to get rid of some old costume jewelry, and it has served me well in that respect as well. I used dresses or blouses with the desired necklines for the necklaces I wanted to photograph, and the pictures turned out magnificently.<br /><br />It cleans up easily, and is light to carry.<br /><br />It has no back, so don't purchase this if you want pics of clothing from the rear-end point of view.	2014-05-07

I have a lot of trouble with dry skin, mouth, and eyes so I needed something that would moisturize my small cubicle.  This is great!  But you need to know the tricks.  First, make sure your USB port is active.  If your computer is asleep, so is the USB port and your humidifier won't work.  Second, remove the little rubber stopper on the top of the lid. This one confounded me for a while.  I thought the steam would come out around it, but not so!  It's tough, so be persistent when removing it.  Last, make sure the magnetic pads on the cup and on the lid line up.  If not, try turning the lid 1/4 turn until these line up correctly.  You may have to jiggle it a bit, but once you've got it, it's good to go.  You should get nearly immediate steam.  And yes, you can see it, so if you don't, something isn't right.  Make sure you push the ON button on the back.  It doesn't turn on automatically when your computer turns on.  Follow these simple steps and you'll have a small, cute, personal cool mist humidifier in no time.	2014-02-06

I want it to work out and think I have benefitted in spite of the problems I have with it. Any advise or help would be much appreciated.	2015-05-17

I almost passed this up after reading the reviews and viewing customer pics. Being that there wasn't anything else comparable on Amazon, I pressed my luck and ordered anyway. I'm so happy I did because the pillow is absolutely beautiful! My estimated delivery date was 7/8-7/15 and it showed up today (7/6) which was a pleasant surprise. I was a little nervous at first because the petals were all flattened when I removed the pillow from the packaging and I wonder how they would stay upright as shown in the picture. All it needed was a little fluffing (as all pillows do when they're shipped in tight packaging) and the flower came to life! I'm so happy with the purchase and I hope that the petals stay perky over time.	2015-07-06

We looked at a number of shower rods and selected this brushed-nickel, curved Moen rod due to its style.  It was a nice change from the standard straight shower rods you see everywhere else.<br /><br />Moen does a nice job to help make installation as easy as possible.  The instructions contain a mounting template for each end of the shower rod.  If the wall has studs, on the template they show you where to drive your wood screws.  If you're mounting to drywall with no stud underneath, they show you where to drill the hole for the wall anchors.  They provide six wall anchors (three per side), but, strangely, they don't provide the wood screws.  This confused me, but it wasn't a show stopper.  Just be aware that, if you will be installing this into studs, you'll have to supply your own screws.<br /><br />Installation was fairly simple and is best done by two people--one to do the drilling/screwing and the other to hold the rod.  The rod swings widely on its plastic mounts, so you can separate both ends and piece them together, if you decide to separate them and mount one side first, then the other.  This allows for an easier install rather than someone holding the entire rod while the first side is being mounted.  When mounting is complete, the end caps snap over the mounting plate to provide a clean and very professional finish.<br /><br />Overall we're very pleased with this product.  Moen has a reputation for making quality products and this shower rod is no exception.  Our bathroom remodel found us selecting Moen products for the shower, sink, and shower rod, and we couldn't be happier with how this rod perfectly matches up with all the other Moen fixtures in our bathroom.	2010-11-30

It's been almost two months of 3am wakings where my 2.5 years old son creeps into our room and tells us he is scared. We end up either letting him sleep in our room or sleep with him in his room. The little sleep we get was getting interrupted every night. I got this for my son and told him if he wakes up and sees the moon, he has to close his eyes and go back to sleep. If he wakes up and sees the sun, it's time to come downstairs to our room. He gets a kick out of the moon and sun! It's been a week is sleeping through the night and we are better rested and loving this product. I made it a point to write this review as part of the hesitation initially was worrying it wouldn't work and it's a little pricy. Worth every penny!	2015-06-11

Shopping in Costco one day & a demo person was talking/seller this item, She said that they wanted her to talk about Wet & Forget because she had used the product for years and liked the way it worked. We bought a double pack and tried it out a few days later. It was easy to apply (read instrucations before using)and one bottle would cover the whole roof. She told us that it would best over time and it did work well for the roof. My husband did not get a chance to do the garage roof, so we can see the diffence over the 6 months since we treated the house and the untreated roof of the garage. We will use it again. PS...Saw it work right away on the driveway. Looks great.	2012-07-17

The poles screw together like all collapsible lamps. However, the threading is so poorly done that they never quite fit snugly together. The result is a lamp that can sway ~2 inches at the top.<br /><br />2) Both boxes came with a broken switch. The boxes arrived undamaged so I can't blame the delivery service. The switches were so poorly designed that the plastic knob part simply snapped off. Of course, the actual switch mechanism is inside of the lamp housing so turning the light off and on means grabbing a pair of needle nose pliers.<br /><br />3) Over quality - not any better than the $20 lamps you can find at any major retailer with a back to school sale.<br /><br />This is one of the most disappointing orders I have ever received.	2013-09-06

You literally have to cut all of the tube off so the stuff will come out, you don't have a choice because if the hole is small which is the purpose of the cylindrical tube it comes out for a split second and stops every time. I've tried 4 tubes of this junk and when it dries and it does come out it's fine but the mess is so thick you have to cut the dispenser tube all the way off to where the hole is huge and cannot be used for small projects. it's worthless for small projects all around, only good for if you need to use the whole thing in one sitting through a giant hole. Too much hassle.<br /><br />Oh and today I tried using this again and guess what, I have to squeeze so hard it popped the back open and got it splattered all over my shirt. what a waste of money and time. i recommend their wood glue only, not this crap."	2012-12-18

Just replaced the recessed light over the kitchen sink in my new condo. The ceiling is over 10 feet high, so I needed to focus the light closer to the sink to wash dishes, etc.    This nifty item, which I accidently discovered at Lowes, saved me a ton of money since I didn't have to contact an electrician to replace the recessed light with a junction box to install a hardwired pendant.    The installation was easy.  I definitely recommend removing the recessed light 'can' so the cover lays flat on the ceiling.  Makes for a nicer installation.    The fixture looks like a professionally installed, hard-wired fixture. The item I purchased has a golden glass shade, it's beautiful.  So happy to have 'discovered' this!  Great invention!  I highly recommend this conversion kit.	2008-09-24

I put two of these in my bedroom over the winter and they seemed to really help with my dry skin and nose. We have gas heat, which is notoriously dry. I had used a humidifier in the past, but I didn't like how it sprayed water mist everywhere and left the area around it all wet. I also didn't like how it got all of that funky pink mold in it and was nearly impossible to clean because of all of the crevices. I decided to try these to see if that would eliminate the need for the humidifier. They really did!<br /><br />You do have to fill them with water every day, but if you just add that to your nighttime routine, you get used to it. They are also plastic, and kind of flimsy on the top. Not super flimsy, but if your regular metal registers support something like a nightstand, or if you step on them regularly, you will not be able to do that with these.<br /><br />Aside from that, these did the job, did not get gross and moldy, and are pretty inexpensive. I am very happy with this purchase.	2015-05-22

I had to take the entire thing apart and put it back together again, I would have been better off without the assembly done for me in the first place.<br /><br />Once I figured that out and got through it, the product works as advertised, can't do more than 3 stars though given the shoddy assembly.

Stayed sharp and cut evenly and true. It has straight fluting, so it did not shed material as well as one with twisted flutes, but I have never trusted twisted flute taps; I always seem to be nearby when the snap off in the workpiece. This one is well made and did the job right the first time. I love Irwin's combo packages like this one. To tap a hole in a common size requires that you drill it out to what can be a very uncommon size. If you need a weird sized bit you almost never can find one locally, as you know. So purchasing the odd-sized drill bit along with the tap makes things much easier. I was worried about using HSS on my application, but Irwin bits hold their edge pretty well in this age of soft Chinese drill bits. And Irwin taps and dies have become my go-to brand. If I did more tapping and threading I might look for something more expensive, but for my uses these guys work great and are usually at a more-or-less affordable price point for me. For me, Irwin combo tap and bit packages come highly recommended in whatever size you need.	2015-06-07

I have several Delta tools and have always considered it a professional tool. This saw had several features I liked and planed on using it when I did not need the 12\\"" slider. After using it for a while I became discouraged with the very inadequate dust bag system. Most of the dust (90%) comes out the front of the blade guard and is all around the work table. Sawdust gets packed between the pinch guard and the spring to the point that the blade will not raise fully. In fact I have to remove the pinch guard and clean the sawdust from around the spring in order to raise the blade high enough to remove the screw on the blade guard to change the blade. I now leave the pinch guard off the machine. The next time I use the saw I will hook up my shop vac to try and get more sawdust away from the from of the machine and off the worktable. <br />Over all I like the saw and will work around the sawdust problem. <br /> <br />Dave"	2005-06-21

When you put the unit into second gear and give it a could of spins with the drill bit inside, it stops spinning abruptly to the point where it starts loosening the chuck (no matter how tightly you tighten it) and eventually letting the drill bit fall out! That's a big no-no in my book. Got another one of these thinking this could just be a bad unit. Tested it at the store - everything seemed to work OK. After a month of use the same exact problem resurfaced. Had to return it again. DeWalt, I loved your 18V model - why did you screw up so bad on this one? Also, why did you get rid of the bit holder at the bottom - that was so handy? When is the next model coming out?	2015-07-23

I purchased these bags to use with my new 14-gallon Ridgid shop-vac They fit inside the vacuum well and did not interfere with the large filter at all. The only issue I had was that I managed to put a small tear in the bag while I was fitting it over the the inside of the tube, even though I was making a conscious effort not to press too hard on the bag while I was attaching it. I placed a piece of duck tape over it and did not have any issues when I was using the vac. So far, the bags have held up to drywall dust, cat litter, drywall chunks, staples and nails, pet hair, and shattered tile pieces.	2013-04-26

Balance is nice, weight is reasonable, adjustments are great as it goes really small and large too--I have a large head @ 8-5/8 and it goes just large enough that I can wear it comfortably while wearing my leather cap or my winter hat!

I got them done professionally, and then I've been touching them up myself. The color starts with the pastel blue then blends into a darker one. I absolutely love the color. My lightened before the blue was applied, and the color looks perfect. The problem is it doesn't last. It fades fairly quickly. Even with only washing my hair 2x per week w/ sulfate free shampoo, and applying a Nexus color protector before and after, the blue doesn't last long. I am constantly touching it up.<br /><br />That said, I get SO many compliments. The color is perfect when it's new and it makes me feel like a mermaid :)	2014-08-07

It came to me well boxed, with protective foam padding that holds all of the glass attachments. Go ahead and trash the instructions...they are useless and laughable. Lots of info online about how to use this and get the best benefits.<br /><br />I use mine with Pond's Rejuveness cream, but you can use many other products, as other reviewers have pointed out.<br /><br />Wasn't expecting miracles with this, but I can honestly say that my skin looks (and feels) fresher and healthier, and my pores are shrinking, which is a very nice thing to happen. I get a little rosy glow just after I use it, so the real difference is seen the next day; for me, anyway. The lines in my forehead have diminished greatly, and are continuing to do so. My crow's feet and dark circles (hereditary!) are on their way out too.<br /><br />I usually work on one area of my face at a time, giving each area about 3 or 4 minutes, and going back to zap the deeper lines when I'm finished. It's actually very relaxing, and can be done watching TV, without much thought or effort.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt when you use it. Just start off with the lowest setting and work your way up. Especially if you use the &#34;sparkle&#34; technique for deeper lines. That can be a little &#34;ouchie&#34; if you zap yourself with a high setting, so definitely start low with that.<br /><br />You're going to get out of it what you put into it, make no mistake. Use it every day, and you'll see results. Use it once in awhile when you think of it, and you won't see results.<br /><br />All in all, it's a really nice at home skin treatment that makes me feel pampered. No regrets with this purchase at all.	2014-02-14

Not Worth Trying!	"I decided to try this product for my eyebrows because I thought I can't really lose anything. If it works once the cost is less than a salon. The problem was it didn't work even once! I followed the directions closely. The wax doesn't melt in the time the directions say (and my microwave is normally very powerful). It's hard to spread...if you get it to thin it won't pull off..too thick leaves bits of it behind. For some reason it really tucked my skin, but plucked very few hairs. I also wouldn't trust the indicator wand to not burn you. Placing it in the hottest part of the wax it continued to show \\""ready\\"". The tweezers are Barbie sized and don't work well at that. The soothing lotion is OK, but the kit includes nothing to clean off the goo with.

That makes it easier to get different parts of my head and beard.  It was a good idea.  The guide combs are very adjustable.  It even works well around my ears.  I knocked off one star because the head shaving attachment doesn't do much.  Also, I hoped to use it without any combs to shape the bottom edge of my beard, but it doesn't really work for that.  The shape is wrong and it doesn't cut closely enough when used in a stabbing motion to try to cut a straight line.	2015-02-22

Give you a nice BROWN tan instead of orange.  my one MAJOR complaint is the application mit that it came with. After two to three uses, the mit became so pilly and crunchy and it would not properly apply the tanner anymore. I had to order a new mit.  My advice is to very GENTLY apply the tanner, otherwise your mit will become pilly and crunchy (and won't absorb the tanner liquid the way it's supposed to).	2015-08-07

I highly recommend this cord. Whats to lose? $27? I calibrated some wheel speed sensors in 5 min while the dealer quoted me $100 for the same work! I also used it to troubleshoot some issues with my ABS and VSC on my toyota tacoma. This cord comes with techstream software which is the only way to pull ABS codes from toyotas newer than 1996.<br /><br />Any bad reviews this product has gotten are sure to be from people who aren't tech savvy. Keep in mind this does come from Hong Kong and who knows where the software was found and copied. The instructions will get you through the install/set up, but don't expect it to hold your sally hands every step of the way. If you can't figure out how to set this up, then you shouldn't be attempting these kinds of diagnostics on your car anyways. If you need that kind of help then go buy the $550 mongoose pro cord and pay $1200 a year for a techstream subscription w/tech support or just sack up and pay the dealer to do it. The software has a minimal learning curve for basic use. I was able to minimize my cost on a full dealer diagnosis/repair by pulling codes and directing them to the specific problem (if I couldn't figure it out myself). For example, I told them the problem areas and steps I took to correct/diagnose and it saved them the time and brought my diagnosis cost from $250 down to $50. Then when I was sure of what to fix they quoted me $1000 and I did the repair for $130.<br /><br />When using this to do legit procedures and calibrating stuff, google what you need to do and you will find excerpts from the factory service manual that will explain how to use the tool. I calibrated yaw rate sensor, decel sensor, wheel speed sensor. You can also calibrate tire pressure monitoring sensors (TPMS) which will save you money if you are tripping codes with new wheels/tires. You can do &#34;health checks&#34; in a couple of minutes (same thing the dealer does at a ripoff price). You can see real time data from any sensor in the car (I have no idea what the data means so that doesn't help me unless I google what it should be). You can pull up and customize graphs of	2014-03-11

They charged me over $100 more than what the watch was going for on amazon, i knew the #98B104 watch was more money and i didn't have a problem with that it was when they shipped me the #98B127 the watch i didn't order, that became the ISSUE!  I was so upset i called, and filed a complaint with amazon and still to this day i have not heard anything from amazon either no call, no email nothing!.  I kept the watch i gave it to him anyway even though that was not the watch he wanted, but he was very understanding and grateful for the gift! I felt like i owed him something more so I ordered him another watch an authentic Breitling Chrono-Matic 49 from a license retailer and he loves it! The lesson learned is sometimes you have to pay for good quality service, and not just being cheap looking for a deal. Don't get me wrong i love deals, but sometimes BS comes along with it!!  I will NEVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN! BE CAREFUL"	2011-03-24

I purchased this watch for my husband who teaches chemistry.  He didn't want anything fancy, but I wanted him to have something that was nicer than the plastic digital watch he wore in graduate school!  The two-tone stretchy band is dressy as is the gold-tone face and it has the essentials:  second hand with date, and day-glo light.  This is his favorite part, since he can check the time in a movie theater!  Also, the stretchy band is a necessity for easy-on and easy-off, in case he has a spill or something in the lab he can take it off very quickly, or slide it up his arm to wash his hands, which he does very frequently.	2009-12-19

Hopefully, you will continue to do so, as you transition into a greater range of what you as a manufacturer are able to produce.<br /><br />*However, the quality of your product is quite lacking translated to the price of your shoe. I am assuming at cost one of your loafers is similar to 9$?

Two things I have a problem with, first off the latch seems to be a little too low in the back so that when you pull it around to the front, it bunches up the whole bag. Maybe that's how it's supposed to be. But it makes it a little difficult to close the outer zipper once you open it. Second, as soon as I saw the long strap I thought 'well that's going to break' and sure enough one of the chain pieces broke in the middle of the street, my whole bag nearly fell in a dirty puddle. I like the bag otherwise so I will probably just make some adjustments to the long strap or just use another one from a different bag.	2013-11-12

With anything you buy, you never get a perfect fit. It is also true with this replacement. The only place it doesn't seem to fit is on the back by the Apple logo and around the lens for the camera.

IIRC, the notch was needed for the AC controls would sit flush with the kit. It took about 5 minutes to cut the notch using a kitchen knife. Nevertheless, it would have been nice if the notch was already there.<br /><br />Once installed, the kit looks great!	2014-05-19

This is a great little unit.  It is water resistant and shockproof, with a rubber case and a 5200mAh capacity, all in a tiny package of 4&#34; x 2&#34; x 1&#34;.  It only weighs about 5 ounces...I love it!<br /><br />This little unit will fit anywhere, and won't hurt anything, as all it's sides are rounded.<br />It has an LED flashlight, that also blinks, as well as a laser pointer for my cat.  ;)<br /><br />On the top of the unit is a button that allows you to check how much juice the unit has, by the use of three green bars.  One bar means you have 33% power left, 2 bars lit is 66% and all three is 100%.  You can extrapolate from there.<br /><br />All ports are covered by a rubber flap, to keep the moisture out. I would not hesitate to take this unit outside in the rain if I needed to.<br /><br />I use and test many lights and power packs, but this one has it all, and in a nice little package.

They do have a tendency to have the wire pull out of the case and the plug. If you buy one, put a little bit of Gorilla Glue around the wire where it enters the case and the plug. When it dries, color the glue with a black magic marker and then the wire will not pull out of the case or plug. The last one I bought had the voltage regulator set a little bit high, about 9.2 volts instead of 8.4. That sounds like a good thing because the extra volt will give the radio an extra bit of power, but that extra volt can overheat the output power transistor, and if you get long winded, it can shorten the life of the transmitter. However, they do work well and I would buy this item again. Well, I did buy this item again. I now have 3 of them.	2015-02-22

I really can't fault the product.  The instructions were clear and all the parts were flawless.  Tools were OK.  If you decide to take this on yourself, the big 'unknown' are the screws used to hold the components together, and, how much force was used to tighten them at the factory.  5 screws were over tightened and the heads stripped almost immediately.  After about an hour, 3 finally came out, somewhat mangled, but re-useable.  2 had to be drilled out. Yep, had to take a power drill to an IPhone.  Not a pretty site, using the smallest drill bit I own, I was able to drill through the heads cleanly.  Fortunately, these 2 just held the side brackets, so I was able to complete the repair sharing the remaining screws.  Next, the cables needed to be reseated a couple of times, but that is just part of the learning curve.  After two attempts the new screen and its functions worked fine.<br /><br />It would have probably taken about 40 minutes, but with the stripped screws, it took over four.  I saved about 60 bucks compared to sending it to Apple, honestly, not a good return considering the frustration and the permanent damage that might have occurred.  I won't attempt this again.	2015-01-17

It's just too costly. A negative with this is that a cell requires a stable signal. In my office at home, which is located in my half-basement, the signal constantly drops out.<br /><br />As someone who works from home one day a week, I can't have this. I need my phone to work at all times, which is why I looked into this wireless extender. At first, I was reluctant to pay a couple hundred dollars for something that's really just a modified router. But, since it is sold by Amazon, I knew that I could try it out and return it without a hassle should it not work out. So I gave it a shot.<br /><br />Since the prospect of drilling holes and running a wire through my walls was less than appealing--before I went to all that trouble--I tested positioning the antenna at different places in my house. At first, I received a full 4-bars on my phone, but after a minute or so, it dropped down again. I thought something was wrong with the extender, but found that there really isn't a great signal in and around my house anywhere. To test this, I installed a Mobile Signal Widget on my Android phone, and then walked around my house, yard, and the top of my roof. What I found was an intermittent signal everywhere.<br /><br />Eventually, I came across a place at the front of my house that stayed around 3-bars on average. On top of that, the signal never dropped out, so I went ahead and installed the antenna at that location (by mounting it to the outside of my house (unit comes with a mounting bracket)). I then ran the included cable (which is quite long) underneath my siding and drilled a small 1/2\\"" hole into the wall that goes into my office. From there I ran the cable through the hole, mounted the unit to the inside wall, and plugged up the hole with calk and insulation.<br /><br />Now my phone seems to stay around 4-5 bars, which is great because the outside signal is only around 3. So far, it hasn't dropped the signal yet, so I'm happy. Where I"	2011-09-19

I can tell you that the only thing worse than being woken up by your phone for no reason is having your wife woken up by your phone for no reason.  Someone told me about the Hale Dreamer and it offers a solution that I never would have thought of -- letting through the calls you want and blocking the ones you don't.  The features are easy to use even at 3 in the morning and it's a nice looking device to boot.  I don't really know all of the technical ins and outs.  I just know that I have been getting a better night's sleep!  Great product."	2013-11-10

My first started to leak water -after 3 years of use and having purchased it from another person- and wasn't repairable.  This newer one is even better.  It locks in on satellites in less than a minute. It took me through a series of questions in the set-up menu so the calorie count burn rate would be accurate. I did go with a refurb for a little more money. I wanted the 1 year warranty.   This newer model has a shorter wrist strap.  Still fits but fewer holes left over at the end.  If this ever dies I will want another just like it.  I use it for mt. biking and running.  I run 2-4 times a week in winter.  3-5 in summer.  Five to 10 miles on average running.	2011-11-28
