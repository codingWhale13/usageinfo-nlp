US	13163478	R3VWFHTTLV3ZMN	B003OSPCJO	85916812	Monopod 500 Floor Standing Monopod	Camera	2	1	2	N	Y	Canon Monopod (Review Edited downward)	I had/have a cheaper and lighter monopod. This Canon is much higher quality - especially in stability when extended. I do have the problem of the ball not locking tightly (30D & 450D various lenses) but haven't tried sanding it yet. I might try sanding the plastic cup area first and hope that cures the problem up. Excellent unit, little heavier than the cheaper versions but not so much as to be cumbersome. It's easy to spin on and off the camera so you might consider buying only it to see if you really need the easy removable head. Is it worth the extra bucks? Depends upon how you use it and if you use a Canon. Always looks neat to have all Canon gear. LOL<br />No LOL now. The head where the camera mounts has become loose - there's enough slop that the camera can shift unless you're really concentrating on holding it in position. This is NOT the ball slipping but the thumbwheel that screws into the camera base.<br />Just spoke to Canon, minimal warranty and NO PARTS IN STOCK only sell complete units.<br />So I have to pin this head in a couple of directions to take the slop out.<br />No, I'm not rough on my gear.<br />Went from a 4 (due to slipping ball mount) to a 2 (lack of repair parts)<br />caveat emptor	2012-03-26

I bought the Instax 210, along with a case and film about 3 weeks ago and it said on my receipt that the order would arrive march 13 2013; however it got to me earlier! Apparently it came in the 11th of march, so it had been sitting in the box office waiting for me.<br />The camera was in good shape, I had no difficulties putting in the film or taking pictures and it's very easy to figure out how to use! I definitely recommend that you by a case so that your camera won't scratch or brake etc. I should also point out that the camera is big, but if you're not bothered you'll love it anyways!<br />BUY IT, hopefully you won't regret it! I most certainly don't!	2013-03-14

The EXTENDED (3400mAh) has not as of yet been tested, but I expect it to be superior to original battery.  Because this battery has a much larger milliAmp rating it is larger than the original.  Consequently, it does not fit into the space of the original, but that's O.K.  Because it is larger it weighs more but the additional weight is not noticible.	2015-06-17

Bought it for my wife and she loves the kit. Everything is wonderful. It is nice to have all the different lenses available to use. The lens filters are perfect for every picture we took.

Got this, (I don't recall it being called &#34;signature&#34; though, it looks identical but I think the color scheme might be switched around, at any rate it is the single hub design), at Costco, for $79!  This is a very good recreational tent, really can't complain after one overnight use with my 2 kids. It is a great size for 2 or 3 people, more than that and you're cramming in.  Fit and finish are very nice, and when pitched and staked, it is a very sturdy tent. Not at all useful for backpacking any real distance, but easy for car camping or a short walk in. I saw one review complaining about moisture inside the tent, to combat this, you can either leave the windows and door open, or cease to breathe. It's condensed water vapor from your breath. It dried out in less than five minutes when I opened the tent up in the morning.<br /><br />First setup took 10 minutes to figure the thing out, but I believe now 60 seconds would be realistic (to set it up, another couple minutes to put stakes up). To set it up, you unfold it, straighten out the legs until they pop straight (no buttons or anything, and there are soft pads over the joints, i'm guessing they are there to protect the tent when it is folded up), the last pole over the door can be put into its sleeve before you straighten it out. Make sure all the little hooks from the tent are around the poles, they were already on on my tent. Then extend the ends of the four corner poles. They telescope out, which raises the tent. I didn't see the telescoping parts for a while and the instructions are bare bones, it wasn't obvious.<br /><br />I had never seen the self rolling windows before, and I really don't understand what the instructions are trying to picture, but basically they are flat springs that work like slap wrap wristbands. They come rolled up in the stake bag, I assumed they were tape or patches or something. To use them You open the Velcro opening under each window, straighten the roller spring completely, and push it up the channel. Then when you want to roll the window up, you just push it in a little bit to set the spring into action and let	2015-03-18

This device was extremely easy to use just connect the power cable (not included) and HDMI cable (not included) to your television plug in your phone and everything you see on your phone is displayed on your TV. I did notice a little bit on a flicker on the TV not as smooth as it could be. I did however like that I can get full stereo sound from my Music Player or Pandora. That is a plus if you do not have a HDTV or Blu-Ray player with Pandora. There is virtually no lag between the device and what is displayed on the TV. The couple of down sides to this product you need a micro USB power cable and HDMI cable that are not included. Also, you are unable to be far from the TV due to the cables if you are showing pictures or trying to browse through things on your phone. So compared to older model phones where you just needed a micro HDMI to HDMI cable you now have to have three things to make this work. The up side to older versions is this mirrors everything on your device not just video sources.	2013-01-19

To a degree they are correct. Honestly though, if indeed this were that simple, then why would there be different HDMI cables offered from the same manufacturer? I suppose for the sucker like me! Sorry but no way! Let's start with this: the performance of the cable, materially perceptible performance anyway, will depend almost entirely on the equipment it is connected to. I'm sorry (again), but a cable is not going to make a bad DVD player (bad chipsets, interlacing capability etc.), or a cheap discount flat screen significantly better. The poor performance is inherent in the equipment itself. Also, you are highly unlikely to see any significant difference on a TV smaller than 50\\"". I have a top end DVD player, Sony PS3 (for Blu-Ray), 2 Hi-Def cable/sat boxes with HDMI output (I can't control the quality level here) and the latest Pioneer Kuro 60\\"" screen and let me tell you, the image is popping out of the screen with ever greater clarity and colors. Most importantly, I see less of the 'jittery' stuff (in layman's terms) than I did before, with already good equipment. So the point is, to take advantage of what 'faster' cables have to offer (which is one of the key things this cable offers with the way it is constructed), certain pre-conditions have to exist. Without these, many people probably are wasting their money...but it works for me!"	2008-11-02

I have the latest/greatest Panasonic plasma (the VT60) in my den. This is my bedroom TV and it replaced an older 720p Toshiba. I'm amazed at the difference. While it can't possibly equal the black levels of the VT60 or its color depth or nuance it's damn good. Razor sharp images, great white levels, excellent flesh tones and good viewing angles (long a pet peeve of mine with LCD/LED's). I want to make particular note of the built-in speakers. Way better than the outgoing Toshiba and much better than the speakers on the VT60. As we all know, sound quality is one area in which flat panels have compromised. Sometimes to the point that the consumer is almost forced to go to an external speaker solution (as I did with the VT60). Not so here. The sound quality is actually well above average and has a resonable amount of bass for such a small system. Is it audiophile quality? Heck no! But it's great for everyday viewing/listening and can even do justice to music with wide dynamic range. While most flat panels give their speakers 2 or 4 watt amplifiers, this has two 10 watt amplifiers built in. This makes a huge difference at moderate (to louder) levels and keeps things sounding clean and non-distorted. For a TV costing well under $500 this unit is incredible. If you want bells and whistles or a smart TV you're going to want to looks elsewhere. If you want a TV that serves as a monitor for your cable/fios feed then this is your answer.<br /><br />BTW for those of you concerned about the \\""outsourced panel\\"" issue let me say that I have the HS03 version (made by Sharp I'm told). It really is superb so have no worries. ;-)"	2013-10-03

OK, I have a 7 year old boy and have purchased every kind of silly putty, noise putty, alien slime, GAK, barrel-o-slime made. This GAK is BY FAR the worst waste of money. First, you cut open the insanely thick plastic package and instead of nice stuff that comes out easily, it's super thick, solid, and you have to scoop it out. My son used a spoon and put all the formed balls in bowl. Then there was no way it would form back together. And it left a disgusting slimy sticky residue on our hands!!! I bought the yellow, and it really looks like a bowl of scrambled eggs. And it attracts hair and dirt like a magnet. I'm assuming that's because of the insane stickiness of this waste of money.

If you make the water rotate, the bubbles will first distribute over the entire cylinder, them go up and concentrate along the cylinder axis (the tornado), before entirely concentrating at the top. The phase in which that tornado-like formation in the middle happens is very short, perhaps two or three seconds; you have to be looking for it to see it. It is to short to tell your children `here look at this, it looks like a tornado':<br />before the children look, the effect is already gone. Children can still have some fun with it, as they can have with anything that moves, but as educational toy it is disappointing.	2012-09-24

Just the 'JACK' which indicates \\""DC6V\\"". AC adapter needs to be purchased separately and adds to overall cost. Instructions state 4-AA batteries are reqd. Listed features on outside of box state 3-AAA are reqd. The winner? Curtain#1, which is 4-AA batteries.  I honestly don't imagine this is a `mobile' item for us, (wouldn't want to show up the pianist at our favorite restaurant), so a power cord for home use might serve best.<br />--- Instruction booklet need major overhaul and is not written in well English very good. It also says the battery compartment has a screw, but it does not.  So if you're worried about small children, know that the compartment does NOT have hardware. (funny how it warns not to use sharp objects on the keys as it could cause `..fatal..' damage, but I'm quite sure it means permanent product failure and not risk to human life.)<br />--- Does using something with only 37 keys, ruin someone from ultimately learning properly on a standard piano, or is it a good start  ?.?."	2013-05-24

My niece already has the mermaid set, so she was beyond excited to see this huge set at my house. She came over with a friend and they played practically the whole day with the dolls and dollhouse. Daisy Girl doll sets are real wood sturdy, colorful and very nicely made. This big set has four dolls, two pets for the dolls and A LOT of clothes, over 130 clothing pieces actually, that are magnetic and stick on very well onto the dolls. SO much faster, easier and less frustrating than changing Barbie clothes!  With so many pieces, there are tons and tons of clothing  combinations...and I think my niece and her friend may have tried every one of them....and everything is in a really cute house to play with the dolls in. It is a very nice, well made set at a good price. I have paid way more for flimsy plastic dollhouse junk. I would say for the three to six, maybe seven age range, you can't go wrong with this Daisy Girls set. I plan on buying a couple of their sets very soon.<br /><br />I would say three to six, maybe seven, is a good age range for Daisy Girls.	2014-09-27

"Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game (BSGBG) is a fun and socially engaging game. For those familiar with BSG, it recreates the first leg of the exodus (post-destruction of the 12 Colonies to New Caprica) (the first expansion takes it beyond that). [For those not familiar with the series, it is about a race of humans fleeing from a \\""race\\"" of robots (called Cylons) that humanity originally created but the Cylons decided to turn on them and wipe them out. The remnants of humanity are now fleeing, seeking a new home. The Cylons have infiltrated the remnants with human-looking Cylons in an attempt to make sure the remnant is doomed to extinction.]<br /><br />  How the game plays is that each player plays as one of the main characters from the series. Each character has a series of skills (ex. piloting/engineering/etc.) where he/she gets cards from as well as a special abilities unique to that character. Then each player is dealt a loyalty card which is kept secret (it will say either you are a Cylon or not a Cylon). Then the President of the Colonies as well as the Admiral of the Fleet are determined (based on an order of succession). (The President gets special ability cards via the Quorum deck while the Admiral gets to determine jump location and command of the nuclear weapons about the Battlestar Galactica.) Each player's turn works along these lines:<br />1) get new skill cards (based on the skills printed on the char. card that he/she is playing)<br />2) perform an action (ex. fire Galactica's guns, launch fighter, get the ship ready to jump, etc.)<br />3) draw a crisis card<br /><br />  It is at the crisis cards that tension builds, since almost every crisis card runs along the lines of \\""unless you have skill cards in total value of X (of 1 or more colors), something bad will happen\\"". This is where folks will say how many skill cards (which all have a numeric value between 1 and 5) they are contributing to the crisis. Everyone then throws in their cards plus 2 additional ones from a \\""destiny deck\\"". The combined deck is shuffled and then flipped over. The skill cards with the colors on the crisis card add positively while any other colors contribute negatively. (ex. A crisis card requires 15 using yellow and green. Well, 7 cards are thrown"	2011-08-29

Then my girlfriend talked myself and one of my children into a diet that included drinking a large quantity of water a day, so I decided it was time to switch to the 5-gallon bottles and a dispenser. Found a wonderful stainless dispenser at [...] that makes hot water hot enough for tea and cold water just right for drinking. So now I have to mess with the 5-gallon water bottles. This basically gave me, I thought, 3 options. Having a water delivery service (very expensive), picking up 5-gallon water bottles pre-filled at a place like Home Depot, or taking the empty water bottles in to Wal-Mart and for $2.00 a bottle, refilling them myself. All of these options required that I have storage for a couple empties, and all of them have varying degrees of annoyance. Then while walking through the Home Depot I came across the Z-bottles by ZeroWater. Seemed like the answer to all of my problems.     So, I bought the bottle and hooked it up. Went easily into the new water dispenser and immediately started making water. I personally really like the taste of the water. I have one daughter who belives it tastes metallic, and a couple other household members who really like it. If you think about it, Dasani starts with purified water (000) then adds stuff to it for flavor, so not real surprising that the flavor is not something enjoyed by all, though I myself am real happy. Would be nice if the ZeroWater people could come up with a second type of filter that would add back some stuff to improve that flavor back to a Dasani flavor or something (believe I heard that Dasani measures like 039 parts per million of total disolved solids.     Anyway, for me, this Z-bottle is the way to go. I'm not storing anything but new filters. No huge 5-gallon water bottles sitting around. I'm not lifting and changing water bottles. I'm not running water bottles to the store, or paying acrazy amount of money to have them delivered. All I'm doing is filling a pitcher with water every night and dumping it into the top chamber of the Z-bottle. Nothing could be easier.    	2010-03-25

Updated Review: I thought we were going to have to return this item, but upon closer inspection we discovered that a rather large hunk of peppercorn had gotten stuck in the grinder mechanism, which will happen occasionally with any grinder. It was easily removed with a toothpick, and now our pepper mill works just fine.<br /><br />This is our third mill from Trudeau, and we really like them. This model is wonderful for cooking, but we also have the longer one that you just turn upside-down to activate. For some reason this is a constant source of amusement for our guests. The only downside is that we go through a LOT of peppercorns. And I'm beginning to wonder why our friends are so easily entertained.<br /><br />These make very nice, inexpensive gifts. I usually keep a couple on hand for this purpose. So thank you, Trudeau, for making such a great item at such a low price!	2013-06-05

The second problem was the &#34;fit&#34; of the top and bottom of the iron.  There was a bit too much play, like a screw was loose or something.  Then when I made the waffles, they were rubbery and not thick, the way a belgian waffle should be.  I will continue to use this waffle iron only because I don't want to throw it away and we don't eat waffles that often.  I was surprised at the workmanship on this product because I thought Oster was a good company.  I previously had a Hamilton Beach waffle iron that worked extremely well so I think when this one goes, I will go back to the Hamilton Beach waffle iron.  Sorry Oster, you just don't cut it in my house.	2014-03-04

But it is worth it, every penny. VERY quiet - couldn't believe it! Less pulp, more juice. The manufacturer claims that more soluble fiber is left in the juice, and that the juice can be thicker. I've not noticed a real difference there, but my 12-year-old centrifugal juicer was very low end when I bought way back then. As for ease of clean-up - MUCH easier than my old one. Cleans up quickly, and with all the alignment marks and things fitting into place just so, it  is a snap to, clean, to put together and to take apart. Heavy duty, I think it will last me a good long time. With Amazon free shipping on items over $25, I scored.<br /><br />While it is called a \\""slow\\"" juicer because of the \\""chewing\\"" action of the screw, it is NOT really \\""slow\\"". So if you're serious about juicing vegetables for the long haul - this is a great investment!<br /><br />(Even with the reduced pulp, I still get enough to make veggie stock afterwards.)<br /><br />Enjoy, juice on!"	2013-03-23

I absolutely love this rice cooker. First and foremost, I received this same rice cooker in red as a Christmas gift from my mother last year. However, I felt daunted by it after one use (where I didn't properly read the manual and used far too little water) and it sat in my cupboard, unused, for quite a while until my boyfriend threw it out by accident as he thought it did not work.<br /><br />On a quest to 1) make healthier dinner choices and 2) find a use for the vegetables that I use for my work lunches before they spoil, I decided to come back to the original rice cooker that I didn't bother tackling before. This time, I chose a different color because white was less expensive than any other color -- which is always great to remember to double-check when you're purchasing on Amazon. At $17, compared to what they sell for in local stores (roughly around $23 at time of writing this), I felt like it was a good deal.<br /><br />For the beginner to rice cookers, you should always remember that you should take every opportunity to &#34;spice things up a bit&#34; -- that is, go wild with your spices that you add to your water! While it may be silly, I didn't even really think about this -- I had this vision of &#34;vegetables and white rice&#34; in my mind when I saw my rice cooker before. Not true! You can change the spices up so many ways to have very different tasting dishes. You can also add a chicken bouillon cube for extra flavor -- just make sure to stir your rice very well after you've finished cooking!<br /><br />In regards to steaming vegetables, I often throw an array of vegetables together -- leftover onion, asparagus, cabbage, etc. I also use frozen vegetables. Yes, frozen! I rinse them with hot water under the faucet in a strainer, drain, and transfer to my steaming plate. I've found that they taste just fine in a hurry and, quite honestly, it's a great way to save on grocery costs, too. I would suggest trying it out! I personally like to salt and peppermy vegetables before I put the lid on top, since it will fall down into the rice during the steaming process.

US	16390321	ROTI7WL4M4CKP	B008JCIWJM	111710305	T-fal EZ Clean Stainless Steel Immersion Deep Fryer	Kitchen	4	1	1	N	Y	The Drain and Oil Container is a Killer Feature	Having owned a deep fryer in the past, I really appreciate how the drain and oil container improve cleanup.  With my previous deep fryer, I would leave/store the oil in the fryer itself, then change it every 8-10 fry sessions.  This meant that I had to spend a significant amount of time/effort scrubbing off the built up and caked on oil on all of the components.  With with this Emeril model, I simply flip the drain switch, come back in a few hours once the oil has cooled/drained, then give the basin and heating elements a quick hand wash.  Overall, the Emeril model stays much cleaner than my last fryer.  Additionally, because the drain has a somewhat dome shape, much of the sediment from the oil tends to remain in the basin after draining, reducing the particulate in your used oil.<br /><br />Two negatives about this model.  First, the display does not tell you the actual temperature of the oil, just the target temperature.  Second, it does not allow you to set a custom temperature, you must choose from several predetermined temps.  That said, the drain/storage feature more than makes up for these deficiencies.	2014-10-13

I love my Laptop Lunch set, but it is made infinitely more versatile with the addition of a couple of sets of Bento Buddies. The Bento Buddies set contains an extra lidded container in each of the sizes already included with the basic Laptop Lunch sets, as well as a large lidded container that doesn't come as part of the basic set.<br /><br />I've been using the system for about 18 months now and can definitely say the more containers you have, the better! Always having a few clean ones stacked and waiting in the cupboard while the used ones are in the dishwasher means that I can plan ahead and pack leftovers and snacks when I have the time, making it pretty much effortless when it comes to actually putting a lunch box together in the morning. The large lidded container in particular is invaluable - there are days when I want to pack lots of nibbly little snacks, and days when I just want to cram in a ton of leftover pasta or chili or the previous night's Thai takeout, or possibly a big salad, and on those days, the cute little boxes just don't cut it!	2011-05-30

Both the mic and vibration tuner options work spot on. The metronome is wonderful touch and plus a ridiculous amount of other features I simply don't use so I can't review it. The problem isn't with the tuner but rather the clamp, the rubber padding will come after to much use, and can be a little frustrating,  the spring as started to loosen up after approximately six months of use which isn't to bad. The paint job will start come off, if you aren't to careful with it but doesn't affect the performance.

When they unwrapped their presents and started the descent into cavity madness, they were thoroughly convinced that I handpicked them straight out of a box of Lucky Charms. Ha! I don't love them enough to do that. Conveniently for me, you can now order *just* the marshmallows from Amazon. Woopwoop!<br /><br />These came in a large plastic bag and were extremely fresh upon arrival.

About once or twice each month I make pancakes with this and they are AWESOME. We always add some cinnamon and sometimes we add mashed bananas or NSA applesauce instead of oil. It's a treat with sugar-free syrup, of course, but it's a far healthier treat than a Bisquick pancake. I have no idea what anyone means about fish or soy taste in the other reviews. Perhaps they aren't seasoning the mix when using it for breading or baking. Even my super picky husband asks me to bake him pancakes with this!	2012-03-01

Mediocre. Meh.	I disagree with the previous reviewer. I paid $14 for one of the bigger jars of the Victoria brand salt and vowed to never buy another finishing salt again. It's sweet, light, and perfect for sprinkling without fear of overkill. This salt tastes like regular $5 salt to me. I'd send it back if it wouldn't cost nearly as much to ship it, but trust me when I tell you the Victoria brand is unlike anything you've ever tasted. I read the backs of both jars and this one is harvested from the whole island, where the Victoria brand is harvested from the one coast. Don't know if it makes a difference, but the sodium content is much higher in this brand and therefore a little too twingy for my taste.	2012-04-10

However, who designed the container? I have large hands for a female, but this is the most unwieldy container I've seen!  I've almost dropped it several times, which would really annoy me considering the expense of coconut oil.  Furthermore, I usually just pour the oil into a measuring cup from other brand's containers, but Viva's container causes significant spillage… more waste.  Viva either needs to make the jar more slender or form some kind of handle into the plastic.  I would not purchase again due to container.	2015-08-15

Whatever it is, probably is bad for the dog and I can't keep her from tearing off the furry part. It sheds without much trying.<br />B) The entire outer part comes off. It's just glued onto a squeaky ball. That's all lit is. My dog was eating the stuff off when I noticed about an inch gone and then I was able to (without effort) just peel away the entire section (half the ball). I came here to post some photos of it but see others have already done it so no need.<br />Lastly, there's a little plastic \\""button\\"" on one end that would eventually get eaten and has a prong inside of it.<br />This toy isn't safe.<br />It's fun, but not safe.<br />My dog isn't a hugh chewer, likes the softer squeaky toys and hasn't destroyed things she's had since she was only 6 lbs. I think it's called a \\""soft mouth\\"". She just takes care of many beloved things. Stuffed animal toys, softer kong things, etc.<br />So I'd think twice about this particular item. It just needs some tweaking to be safe. It's a wonderful idea because unlike regular tennis balls it squeaks without too much effort. Hope this helps."	2013-09-28

I found it easy to set up also.  This web site  does not let you down. I got much better service from here than from PetSafe. Within a day of asking for an exchange Amazon had already mailed the replacement and everything is working once again. PetSafe wanted the item returned and would review the return within 48 hours of receiving it....how am I keeping the dog in the yard while I wait for the review?! Not so funny how a company that sells pet products and is called PetSafe cares much less than Amazon about replacing a defective product like the in-ground fence. That's why I buy from this sight. In less than 60 days it has stopped working. The open loop signal started going off even when I cut a short piece of wire to test the transmitter to make sure the buried wire was not broken. The fuse did not burn out so I assume the electronics were defective. This is disappointing and hopefully the replacement from them will not be a problem.	2010-08-06

I shopped around for weeks looking for the right collar for us.  I chose this one because it wasn't to cheap or to expensive. Our dog has been running away for the past 6 months and no matter what we tried she continued to runaway. I got the collar 4 days after I placed my order and 20 minutes after I received the collar my dog was 100% trained!!!  I put the collar on our dog and of course in seconds she took off across the street I had the collar on the 9 shock setting and when i pushed it the dog stopped in her tracks!! She ran straight back to the yard and laid by my feet. 20 minutes later the dog took off again, I shocked her and she came right back. Since then our dog hasn't even looked outside the yard and I haven't had had to shock her since. Its been 2 weeks and she is an entire different dog! I would buy the collar again any day. It works amazingly and all I need to use anymore is the beep one time and daisy come right away. This collar is well worth the money and then some, it changed our lives and made our dog a perfect family pet. Thank You!	2014-05-03

I was extremely disappointed in the door design, workmanship and overall quality of this crate.  More so because I have owned Midwest Ultima crates since 1998.  My previous crates from this company were well-made, strong, sturdy, and the two I have are still going strong.  I needed another 42-inch crate for my car to transport my new dog, and was initially very happy that I could get one for a less expensive price than I had previously paid.  But that should have been the warning sign.  The crate was flimsy, did not open easily without catching on other parts of the crate; the doors did not open and close smoothly - I had to giggle the doors to get them to line up with the slide latches & openings.  The crate handle was missing, although I doubt it would have been useful.  I am returning the crate for a refund and will shop around for something of better quality.  Even if I have to pay more.  To Midwest Homes for Pets... this was a huge disappointment.  Please revive your old methods of manufacturing these crates, and make them like you used to.	2014-10-07

The outside is made of a thick, almost upholstry-type fabric, and it is lined with faux-lambswool. The bed part is so cushy and inviting, I couldn't help but stick my head in there! The cover is stiff enough to provide an envelope for your pet to crawl into, but it folds around them nicely, like a thick blankie.  <br />It is machine washable, a definate plus! The color is similar to the picture: kind of a cadet blue with a subtle stripe pattern, and the inside is cream colored. My pup had NO reservations about heading in there!

We bought to supplement our worm composting, as the worms can't keep up with the yard waste now that growing season is here. I had no problems putting it together. Took maybe 10 minutes, and my kids helped. It is a little smaller than I imagined, but that's me, the description is accurate. Working fine so far, only adjustment I would like is if the top opening was a little larger, it's a little tough when you have a big armful of stuff to shove it through the small door on top. Will buy another when the price is right.	2013-06-15

I have had this grill for 2 years now. It stays outside, with the fitted cover. Yes it has rust were the coal tray is, which is to be excepted as much as I use it.<br /><br />Couple of cons.<br />The front wooden tray has very week metal supports. Very flimsy design. The side wooden tray metal support are a better design but not good enough to support the grills weight when moving it. Lastly. The wheels, its a grill they always suck.<br /><br />Pros.<br />Thick gauge steel design has proven to stand up. Tubular housing construction is a major plus. This grill is sturdy and solid because of it. The cast Iron grates are freakin awesome.<br /><br />This is a great grill to own. Some advice from me. Buy a spray bottle. put about 4 ounces of olive oil, 20 or so ounces of any other cheaper oil and top with water. Shake to mix. Spay the outside of grill, inside of grill and grates. This will season it and help protect the grill. I do this every so often maybe once every three or four months. I use this mixture on the grates every time I cook to help keep the grates non-stick, and flavored.<br /><br />Remember this grill is metal, it will mostly likely sit outside or in your garage. Some parts will rust, None have evn came close to rusting through the metal. Know how to take care of your grill. If you just want to use it once or twice a year, then maybe you should just go to the dollar store and but a 10 or 20 dollar model there every year.	2014-09-20

These may be good if you plan to tie a thin string or rope to the tops, but otherwise it will be hard to use them for anything else.  I guess these were not the best choice for my needs.	2014-04-22

These were advertised as dishwasher safe.  Well, sometimes they are, and sometimes they aren't.  I've had numerous ones come off in the dishwasher while others stay firmly attached.  The ones that do survive the dishwasher usually do not survive a second canning process, so they have limited use for canners.<br /><br />The other thing I didn't like about them is that even after the chalk dries, it is way too easy to wipe off the lettering just by casually touching it.  I never had to use glass cleaner to remove the chalk.  I just looked at them and they practically wiped clean.<br /><br />Overall, I think the labels are decent enough but not terribly practical for canning purposes--which they are advertised for.  I will go back to the labels that dissolve next year.	2015-01-05

Yes, it is light weight and has good safety ratings, but it is not a quality seat, you will be disappointed.  First off the canopy is super loose and baggy, it drags on the ground and tears/gets dirty.  The rubber grips on the bottom of the carseat fall to very easily.  The canopy is difficult to pull taut, doesn't provide much as far as sun protection.<br /><br />With that said, they do provide EXCELLENT customer care and go out of their way to make sure you are happy, unfortunately, this carseat is a flawed design.  I have had to have this carseat replaced already ( my baby is only 4 months old), and I am already having the same issues. I really hope Maxi-Cosi fixes this design!	2015-01-06

The sling cradled him very comfortably. Now at 4 months he is too big for the sling. He seems very uncomfortable sitting in the tub without the sling. When i use the slanted side for newborns, it seems to squish his little &quot;boy parts&quot;. He is still too small for the other side which sits up more. We will try this tub out for a few more weeks, hopefully he will grow to like it a little more as he gains more control. The drain plug is nice, and it fits great in our sink. The slip resistant pads keep him in place too.	2003-03-20

I was making a slow turn into a bike lane when I experienced the much dreaded toe overlap - where the rider's foot interferes with the front wheel.  This isn't uncommon with small framed bikes that have large 700c wheels but it's usually more of an annoyance than anything else.     Maybe it was the pressure from my foot on the thin plastic that caused the front fender to fold under itself which resulted in the bike coming to an abrupt stop, causing me to fall. I can only be thankful that it happened in a buffered bike lane rather than in traffic, and that I only sustained a sprained wrist. I'll be removing these fenders as soon as I regain use of my left hand.    ==============  Original Review    Its been two days since the fenders arrived and I began trying to install them on my '04 Sirrus. I had previously used [[ASIN:B002KCFSPI Planet Bike Hardcore Road Fender]] so I presumed these would be similar.   Right out of the box I noticed they appeared quite slim and although they're recommended for tires up to 700x28 they're a close fit on my Armadillos 700x25.    The 42m bolt supplied was a bit too short for my Specialized Sirrus fork so I would up using the old bolt that originally came with the Hardcore Fenders.  The plastic clip that secures the rear fender to the brake bridge was a press fit on my old Hardcore fenders and held the the fender firmly in place. On the Cascadia the same bracket has a loose fit and will slide up and down the fender. More importantly these fenders lack the metal tab that hooks onto the chainstay connector and helps keep the bottom portion of the rear fender in place.     Like others have mentioned, I also had a bolt in the chainstay connector so I cut a slit to slide the fender over the bolt. What I didn't anticipate is there's very little clearance with the front Nexave Derailleur. As a result the fender is pushed back and winds up rubbing against the rear tire. While this worked perfectly well with the old Hardcore fenders,	2009-12-07

Putting this together Christmas Eve, my husband wondered if my 7 year old son would really have any interest in it.  He thought is was too much like a big wheel and would be boring for him.  Christmas morning comes and son seems excited about it but really has no clue as to what will happen when he rides it.<br /><br />Later that morning, son and husband go outside to ride and son comes running back in the house, face flushed, laughing hysterically - he had no idea it would turn on a dime and he absolutely loved it.  Kid from down the street came over and he tried it and hated it!  He said he would never ride it again because he was afraid of it...I see this as a good thing!<br /><br />I do wish the seat were adjustable because my son is very tall for his age and I don't know how long he will be able to ride but it really is a lot of fun and is a good quality product.	2013-12-30

That was a few years ago, the ones I ordered most recently were super thin - we're talking thin dress sock thin - and they also seemed quite a bit bigger than the previous pair. My heel slips out of my cycling shoe with these socks. I'd highly recommend getting a bit thicker or nicer pair of socks, even for hot weather.	2013-07-31

On past trips I carried two conventional wheeled bags and wanted one bag for all my travel needs but still be able to stay within the 50 pound limit.  I was totally amazed by how roomy this duffle is and yet still relatively lightweight, weighing just under 11 pounds.  Yet it is extreemly well constructed and rugged.  I took a total of 6 flights on the trip and there is no evidence of any wear at all, although in fairness there should be no wear at this point.  The big thing I liked is the separate zipped compartment in the bottom of the bag where it holds a LOT of clothing and other gear.  The top compartment is great for shoes, rain gear, sweaters and anything you don't mind getting a bit wrinkled.  There are three other zipped compartments also which come in handy for misc items.  It is very easy to stay well organized with this duffle!!!  The bottom line is I got everything I needed to take on this trip in this one bag and still came in at 47 pounds, which amazed me.  The wheels roll very easily and are designed into the bag somewhat which should reduce the potential for getting broken when being tossed around.  Another big plus is the top handle which makes it much easier to handle the bag and load in/out of car trunks or van storage space.  I highly recommend this duffle - it is far superior to any other I researched and I spent a lot of time reviewing various rolling duffles.	2010-03-25

Frogg Toggs are simply the best and are unbeatable. This is a set for my wife, so she'll stop taking mine.

There's simply no way yours won't be kept safe and secure here.  I opted to take scissors to the sewn-in dedicated case and then I handed that piece of finery over to a friend whose iPad has been going naked.  I did this partly because my iPad case is already substantial and because this freed up space inside the bag.<br /><br />You couldn't ask for a better, more thoughtful piece of engineering.  It's as if someone at Timbuk2 followed me around and studied my needs.  All sorts of cool pockets, secure and just the right size.  But not too many.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the velcro is just a bit too strong--and it loves catching hold of my clothing when not secured.  A small price to pay for something that is as cute and perfect as this sweet bag.	2012-06-15

The stove is unbelievably light and fits in a tiny sack which can easily be stored inside pots and pans for protection. It is also surprisingly stable considering its' size. The manual says the stove is compatible only with Coleman propane/butane canisters but it will work with any propane/butane canister. I used the MSR brand. I used one 4 oz. cannister in four days (7 meals plus boiling water for tea, hot chocolate). In summary, this is a great product for a great price. Similar stoves I looked at were heavier and twice the price.	2008-07-05

My last printer was a Canon and it broke down after just a year and to say the least I was very disappointed with it.  So I thought I would look for another printer.  I went to various magazines and on-line reviews and they this printer very good standing.  I decideded to purchase one and I love it.  All the controls are in the front and in an order that make sense.  Also, it found my Wi-Fi network all on it own.  My wife's new laptop found it and installed all the necessary drivers and she now prints her stuff from the living room where she does most of her work.  She has all the features of the printer as I do.<br /><br />The setup was very simple and it took me about 10-15 minutes to do the entire setup.  It also went on the internet to get new updates of software and firmware.  I suggested this printer to a neighbor and I let him have temporary access to my network and he was able to print a 20 page report, which included charts and images.  He lived 2 doors down and across the hall and he had no problems with the printout, he used the auto duplex and he was shocked at the crispness of the report.  He also sent a fax to my printer using an older fax machine and I handed it to him and the fax was just great.<br /><br />He decided to order one and he was going to order the large cartridges and I told him not to, because Kodak included the large cartridges.  Also I told him the cost of the cartridges and he could not believe [[ASIN:B005K8AV2Y Kodak HERO 6.1 Wireless Color Printer with Scanner, Copier & Fax]] how cheap they are.<br /><br />I have also printed out some images of mine that included images I had taken through my telescope and they came out wonderful.  They came out so wonderful, I sent a set to my mother, who has a sight problem, and she could see the images so well, she could make out what the images so well, she could tell what objects they were.<br /><br />I recommend this printer for anyone	2012-05-04

I have a 5 year old and a 4 year old and my 5 year old has been writing fine since he was 3, so when my 4 year old continued to draw scribbles and have no interest in forming letters I thought it might be a grip issue. I bought those triangle crayons and then triangle colored pencils and nothing changed. Therefore i concluded that the traditional triangle pencil grip would not help much either. I bought this one because I saw someone posted a that it was great for their child with cerebral palsy. My child doesn't have that but if helped the other kid then it stands to reason it could help my kid. As soon as the grip came I helped my son put his fingers in and I kid you not he wrote his name and a bunch of very detailed stick people. It was like he understood how but his little hands just weren't fine tuned enough to do it for him. I'm sure developmentally he would have eventually got the fine motor skills down, but why not give him something to help him get there quicker? It might not be such a miracle grip for everybody but for the price, I'd sure try it before I let a teacher label my kid as &#34;special&#34; because he only draws scribbles. Just sayin' :)	2015-01-08

I will not get into all the positive details because all this review is to point out a couple of cons and I want to keep this simple.  There are many very good detailed reviews talking about all the pros already so no point in restating them.  There are two cons and I wish I knew about then before I purchased the phone, and did not read about this information in the reviews.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1. First, there is no audible sound letting you know you have messages, something I thought was standard on all answer phones these days.  But you can program the phones to have a small blinking light when there are unread messages through the code system so not too bad.<br /><br />2. This is my biggest con, and I cannot figure out why phones have to be so complicated.  You would need a small college course to learn everything.  There are 47 pages of detailed instructions on how to use all the features.  You should be able to navigate to a function using an intuitive menu, not having to look everything up in a book.  One example that I could NOT find this in the instructions is that when someone calls you but does not leave a message, you get the words \\""Missed Call\\"" on the phones' displays.  There is no easy way to delete this so basically your phone will always say \\""Missed Call\\"" and you will always wonder was this an old call or a new call.  Here is the 9+ step solution to delete it from your display:<br /><br />a. Hit the \\""Menu\\"" button<br />b. Hit the \\""#\\"" button<br />c. Look up code in book (it is 213)<br />d. Type in \\""213\\""<br />e. Hit \\""Scroll List\\""<br />f. Find phone number to delete<br />g. Hit \\""Erase\\"" button<br />h. Scroll to \\""Yes\\""<br />i. Hit \\""Select\\""<br />j. Now, if you received 10 calls, do this 9 more times<br /><br />3. There are two pages of codes for you to use to program with.  I doubt you will memorize them so you will need to keep the instruction book out for reference.<br /><br />4. Even with 47 pages, not all the information is in the manual,"	2012-11-08

There was an annoying background noise, however, I have not yet experimented with the filter settings to remove it. Also, can use software such as Audacity to remove the noise. Easy to import dictation to my PC, however it was slow. I have not yet tried Dragon Natural Speech with it.    Uses 2 AAA cells giving longer battery life. Also easier to recharge since it uses a set of 2 NiMH cells.	2008-02-09

You can try out move variations, and undo moves all the way back to the beginning. The color and the graphics are great as well. You can select from different board styles and pieces. If you love chess or have wanted to learn you should get this module.	2001-05-23

I bought this phone back in July, and bought an extra handset (4 total).  I was replacing a vTech system that I loved - a 2.4gHZ with 4 handsets.  It has all the same great features - speakerphone on each handset, intercom which can be used like transfer because it will put a caller on hold while you call the phone of someone else in your house (to alert them the call is for them).  Two things would make this system perfect - 1, a speaker phone on the base and 2, a message signal on the handsets.	2006-12-03

Bought this on the basis of overall positive reviews on amazon. Saw a few negative reports, but was certain it wouldn't be my experience!  Long story short -- despite a strong internet signal coming from my modem (comcast twice reset my modem and it worked great when plugged directly into a computer), this router would not deliver internet wirelessly. Worked with three different (overseas) customer service reps over a five hour period. One hung up on me when we were making no progress, the other did not call me back as she said she would, and the third was actually quite helpful ... so much so that I had an internet signal for about 12 hours. And then it died and did not come back. Wife's home office was down, kid's xbox live xmas present was a dud, a day of work down the drain, and I frankly didn't have the endurance to deal with a new batch of customer service people - packed it back up and returned to amazon (the easiest part of this transaction!).	2011-01-06

I then called again and when I got a &#34;specialist&#34; in the Philippines who was very slow in understanding the issue, I asked to be transferred to a US Kindle &#34;specialist&#34;.<br />She told me that my brand new Kindle was several software versions behind and that the only way to update it was to manually download and install the latest updates which she assured me would fix the problem.<br /><br />After another week, the battery is again near zero charge despite updating the software and turning off wifi 99.9% of the time.<br />I am about to waste time yet again with Kindle support when the issue is obviously a faulty battery.<br /><br />The Kindle Paperwhite charge is listed as keeping a charge for up to 8 weeks and only needs to be charged on a monthly not weekly basis.  ?????	2014-05-20

When you get it, it is almost apple green, but it is transparent so it'll tone down when the cover is on the laptop. I don't know why some people say the bottom does not fit. Mine fits perfectly. I have a C55-A. The way you have to put on the bottom is a little tricky. You'll have to but the back notches into where the laptop folds first (if that makes sense) and everything else will click into place. Maybe that's why people think it doesn't fit.<br />Pros: So far protecting my laptop. The two legs are a nice feature.<br />Cons: The top cover makes it heavy and the laptop will have balance issues or fall if you open it too much. The legs help with this issue.	2014-10-29

Unfortunately this is not the case. After charging my ASUS Transformer Prime for 8 hours, I powered it up.  It went directly to set-up.  After selecting the language, the screen read, WiFi connecting.  It never went beyond that spot.  After reading a few forums, I found out that this has been an ongoing problem with this tablet.  The forums suggested a factory re-boot.  I decided to return the product.  I noticed on closer inspection a few sign of previous use.  Fingerprints on the back of the tablet and a smudge on the screen.  I am not sure it was a new tablet.  I did package everything up to return to Amazon, printed a label and shipped back the tablet. I called before returning the package and talked to customer service.  They were great and the agent even offered to send me an e-mail when the package was delivered to Amazon.I have to say that I buy almost exclusively from Amazon and I have only returned one other purchase due to the wrong item being shipped. I feel that this is a problem with ASUS, not Amazon.	2012-07-09

Most recently all my files disappeared, and the drive is showing that it's empty.  This just happened overnight.  Iomega is not at all helpful.  Indeed, if you try to post a comment on Iomega's website asking for recovery help (nothing nasty just for help), Iomega moderators will not post it.  The drive cannot be counted upon for reliable backup.  Shortly after I got the drive, half of its capacity just disappeared and Iomega's only advice was to reformat the drive.  My last problem with this drive is that even though it purports to be gigabit, it's incredibly slow to read or write to -- what's the point of having gigabit ethernet if the drive itself can't read or write files at more than 1% of that speed?  It's painfully slow for computer backups and has trouble sending video files over a hardwired connection to my router (and then hardwired to the TV).	2011-01-15

Works fine in dual channel too (no idea why matching chips wouldn't, but I thought I'd add that).<br /><br />Anyway, it's working great, though I did have to set my memory frequency manually in the bios to keep the rig from BSODing (stupid motherboard issue, NOT the ram)  Please note this stuff did NOT like to run clean at slower settings, which is hardly uncommon, though some of the higher quality (the turbo racing stuff with neon and heat sinks on it) has a broader tolerance for motherboard Auto setting idiocy.<br /><br />Anyway, for the price, this is awesome.

Ok first off I'm not a novice at setting up network devices nor a newbie to this stuff, but this thing is about to go in the garbage!<br /><br />We purchased this because my husband won a blu-ray with streaming capabilities from work and it's not wireless, so we thought from the description and such that this adapter would work to hard-wire the blu-ray to our wireless network without running 80ft of cable from one end of the house to the other end and upstairs. Well it has been useless so far!<br /><br />I have no idea what is wrong but I cannot get this thing to setup. I'm running Windows 8, ( have tried on a 2 other computers as well Windows 7 and Vista) I see the router (Wireless N) in available connections, I click on it. The software asks me for the router pin (we have a belkin router) I enter it, then enter the network name I'm using and the password..then the stupid thing says my router pin is wrong (it is not wrong!, logged into router to check it and then I entered it correctly about 30 times, then changed the pin and enter new pin another 30 times..it's not me enter the incorrect pin). This occurred on all 3 computers, each running a different Windows operating system.<br /><br />There is no support page online and no customer service numbers so if anyone has any ideas, I would much appreciate it. I will check this for about week..no responses and this damn this is going back!	2013-08-11

The whole deal - mini and charger cable plus wireless mouse - only take up as much room as a hardcover novel. The mini is also fully Skype-ready, with camera and mic. Plus it serves as a charger for anything you need to take that charges through a USB cable (it can handle 220 voltage).  I am pretty sure you can find these new for less than $300, so shop around.	2010-09-23

First, it is very nicely made and is an exacting fit, and that is where the problem comes in. It fits so snugly that the power button on the cover hits the power button on the kindle and it starts turning the kindle off. The fix is to put a small piece of duct tape on the cover by the power button so that it creates just enough space to prevent the cover button from turning it off. Yeah, duct tape saves the day again.  You also have to view the photos that came with the cover carefully of how to fold it. If you fold it out, it doesn't work as well because the magnets won't keep it folded. Once you get past these two hurdles, you're set.	2014-12-27

I purchased this oversized leather guest chair for the guest bedroom I assembled in my apartment earlier this year.  It arrived several days sooner than Amazon told me it would.  The bonded leather was in perfect condition, no discoloration, no tears.  The legs are exactly perfectly balanced - no issues with mismatching holes or one leg shorter than the other.  I am pretty heavy and I sat on that chair and it didn't budge!  The person I ultimately rented the bedroom to sat on this chair and smoothed his hands over the seat of it - he kept saying, &#34;nice furniture&#34;!  This chair is a wonderful addition to any guest bedroom, living room, sitting area - whatever.  It's HOT!	2013-12-21

It is now January and so far no problems. I run it plugged in but have tested it with batteries also.<br /><br />Although I did not purchase this through Amazon I wanted to leave a review so buyers can beware. I bought this fan about 6 weeks ago from The Warming Store and it has already stopped working properly. The low setting still works but it goes slower than it did originally. The high setting turns on for about 2 seconds and then stops. It will keep trying to start but then jerks and/or only spins once and stops again. The high setting is completely useless now. I see others have had the same issue. Maybe we all got a defective batch. I've contacted The Warming Store about a replacement and I'll report back on how they handled the issue.	2015-07-11

Our plan was to buy a one story home and never again need to be high up on a ladder. Well, we found our one story home, but quickly realized our current 12 foot telescoping ladder wouldn't reach most of the exterior (or interior heights.) Since I would be the one getting on the ladder, above all else I wanted stability. The ability to store the ladder in a small space was also high on our list of requirements because as homeowners, we will only need to use the ladder a few times a year.<br /><br />This weekend we tried out the ladder. We had minor repair work that was needed on our stucco due to chipping from a recent hail storm. The damage was at various heights and on three sides of the house. We knew we could handle the job, the problem was being able to reach all the areas that needed a touch-up. Additionally, there are significant grading issues around the perimeter of the home to contend with so the ladder needs to be quite flexible in its positions. This ladder enabled us to make short work out of a small but tedious task, and permitted us to reach around windows and downspouts while in its extension ladder configuration.<br /><br />We own a cosco 12 foot telescoping ladder, so we were definitely comparing the Werner ease of use with that ladder. The position changes were accomplished much easier and with greater efficiency with the Werner. I also felt more stable on the Werner ladder even though both our cosco and Werner ladders flare out at the bottom for greater stability. The only difficulty we encountered was in using the highest position of the extension ladder. The cosco is smaller and thus more manageable. It would have been helpful to have read the reviews before trying out the full extension because another reviewer's suggestion of extending the bottom half of the ladder and then leaning the ladder against the house while raising up the top portion would have been more safer and easier. We ended up laying the ladder on the ground and each taking an end, which is also how we released the extension -	2009-12-21

The curved elegant neck is exactly what I was looking for and is what sold me on this faucet.  I did a lot of research and price comparison before purchasing this faucet and amazon's price was the best - over $30 cheaper than the big box hardware store.<br /><br />I do not have any problem with splashing on the countertop and the pull out head is long enough to fill a bucket on the floor.  The neck swivels from left to right and the handle is easy to adjust the temp and water flow.  I did have to have it installed with the handle in the front vs the side because my backsplash did not provide enough room to move the handle but I like the handle in front better anyway.<br /><br />I love it!	2013-12-31

First I traced around the old brackets with pencil, so I would know where the new brackets should be placed.<br />2. Unlatched the bracket that wasn't broken by inserting a phillips screw driver in the hole above the spring and depressing the spring while simultaneously pulling the metal drawer side out of the bracket.<br />3.  Removed the old drawer brackets and replaced them with the new brackets.<br />4.

The motor sounds a lot different compared to the Badger, but it works fine.    If you're at all handy, the installation of the actual unit is pretty easy.  But I do have a few pointers.    1.  Make sure the rubber cushion mount ring is seated properly on the sink flange.  Just the top lip of that rubber ring should seat in the channel of the flange.  It is easy to seat the rubber ring too high, one notch up, so to speak.  It looks right, it feels right, but it's not right.  If it's too high up the flange, it won't let the metal mount ring slide down enough.  You'll lift up the disposer and there won't be enough clearance for the bayonet-mount (those nubs)on the disposer unit to mate with the mount ring. Pretty frustrating at the time.  But once I found my mistake, it was easy to hang the disposer.    2.  Go ahead and put some soft soap on the bottom of that rubber ring before you hang the disposer.  I didn't, and it took a bit of effort to get that mount ring turned fully.  A little soft soap should make it slide more easily, and the less you torque on everything down there, the better.      Other than that, it was a piece of cake.  As mentioned, it comes ready to plug into an outlet.  If you don't have an outlet, you'll have to add one, or wire hardwire the unit using the included directions.	2011-05-19

This makes my third and final planer. This is one excellent machine. I have ran mostly hard wood thru this machine. It has a two speed gear box on it. You get your board all most ready then you shift it into low gear and a couple of light passes thru, and the board is almost ready to stain. That is how smooth it gets it. My other two planers are not even close to this one. Yes it is a little loud, but most of them are. The thing weighs almost 600 lbs. With the cast iron rollers it moves like it weighed hardly anything. I have yet had to sharpen the blades on it. like I said above I run mostly hard wood thru it. I would say I have run almost 1500 board feet thru it with no problems at all. The only thing that I wish it would of come with is a helical head on it. That way when I do have to sharpen the blades I wouldn't have to mess setting them. All in all this is one great machine, and you will not be disappointed you bought one.	2010-07-02

I took this flashlight outside, and narrowed the beam all the way to its most narrow. Then, I aimed it at some tree-tops that were about 300 feet away, and it lit up those tree-tops like daytime.<br /><br />I really like being able to click to the more dim option as a power-saving step.<br /><br />This flashlight is pure awesomeness, and I can find no cons with it.	2015-04-23

The light has 4 different colors, white, red, green, and blue.  I use the white which provides plenty of light for night preflight inspections.  Once airborne, I use the red to use in the cockpit to perserve night vision, and I use the green for map reading to also preserve night vision.  With no need to change lenses, this is the only light you will need.	2010-02-14

I had been to the dentist in less than 5 months for a cleaning and I floss and brush every day, yet my teeth had patches of tartar that seemed to come overnight and my lower gums ached.  At first I didn't connect the symptoms with this product, but while searching for solutions for the tartar problem and considering a product called Periogen, I came across Amazon reviewer comments discussing the possibility that some oral antibacterial products, by destroying good bacteria as well as bad, may somehow lead to more tartar growth. Periogen, apparently, is not in that category, and I plan to try it as a tartar dis-solver.  I don't know for sure if Katz Perio gel really caused the problem, but it seems a strong possibility since I made no other changes. I decided to go back to Tom's of Maine, which I've used for years. I wanted to give this warning in case someone else experiences the trouble I had with Katz.  I should also mention that in the years before I had begun using Tom's of Maine, I always did have excessive tartar formation, so I must be prone to it, but nothing on the level of what happened almost overnight when using the Katz gel.	2011-07-06

I ordered this based off the many positive reviews.  While the trimming function worked fine the operation of the unit failed after only a few months.  The battery compartment seems to frequently lose connectivity with the inserted battery resulting in the trimmer failing to turn on.  Happened numerous times where I'd have to play with the battery compartment, opening and readjusting the battery and reattaching and eventually it would turn on.  Eventually the entire device went dead and it no longer is functional.  For the low price I can't complain but it certainly did not live up to the numerous 5 star reviews.  Also, the angled design of the trimmer caused it to frequently fall over on my medicine cabinet shelf.	2015-03-01

I purchased Cathy Doll about a year ago and still have the giant bottle half full. First of all its freaking sun screen and nothing more. It will not make your skin lighter over the course of using it. When you apply it it has a strong floral fragrance which is nice but when you apply it its just like normal sun screen. Its super runny so do not squeeze the bottle too much because it will all run out of the bottle. So be careful. It leaves a white cast on you and if you are darker it will just look gray and ashy. Its just korean sun screen that says whitening because of the supposed &#34;glutathione&#34; in it. However, glutathione is proven to not change your skin if used topically on the skin. It is probably called whitening sunscreen because it makes you look white or &#34;pastey&#34; when you initially apply it. It is water proof but when you scrub it off your back to your normal self. I do however, like it as a normal everyday sun block on my face. So its okay...	2015-07-31

I had picked up my electric toothbrush around Christmas time, I picked one up for my brother and figured I'd get myself one too, then after a couple of months I noticed the color start to wear away on the bristles indicating the time to get a new head. So while I was out running errands I figured I'd drop into a bestbuy and check out the heads, $30 for three replacement heads!?!?!?!?!?! Talk about price gouging, and they weren't all that much better even here on amazon. That's where these came in, for half the price of the three heads offered Phillips, you get 4 replacement heads, which also include different colored rings for the base in case multiple people use the same tooth brush. Save yourself some money, and get these.	2015-05-15

When I opened the box this came in up, the entire thing smelled like Muguet des Bois. I found out this was because the cap had not been secured all the way and was clamped down on the spray mechanism the entire time, dumping out perfume to about a quarter of an inch below the label. It was all stuck in the bubble wrap that was around the bottle and so it didn't leak everywhere, but it was pooled around the bottle.<br /><br />It smells exactly as I remember (like lily of the valley), and is perfect. Only reason it gets a 4 is because I lost a good portion of it to greedy bubble wrap.	2014-03-13

You can find this in some Wal-Mart stores for .97 cents, but if you're not able to get out in town that often, it comes in handy buying from sites like Amazon. I paid 3 dollars for mine, with no shipping, but if you tally that up you've basically paid a dollar for the nail polish & 2 dollars for shipping, which is perfectly fine by me. Black nail polish is my go-to color. Wet n Wild does the job for me. Yes it comes off fairly easily, but nothing a little touch up can't fix. So sure it probably deserves 4 stars, but I rated it 5 because its worth it for me. Hope this review helps someone, I know I can be a bit of a rambler.	2013-10-19

From the first time I put in on my face, my face felt good. It made my skin feel soft and healthy after only a few times of using it. I must state here for this review that I have really good skin and a good complexion to begin with - and I want to maintain it which is why I wanted to try this product line. I've done a lot of experimenting and have yet to find anything that I love enough to stick with. However, this may just be the product line for me. I think that it is important to accurately pick the products within the Boots line that are for your skin type. For example, I have dry skin so I would never think of using anything other than formulas that are for dry, mature skin. I want to keep my skin looking good and healthy. I use this product with the day and night cream and I love the face wash (cream). My husband has noticed that my make up looks smoother and better when applied and I attribute this to the new Boots products that I'm using. Thus far, I'm very happy with this brand.	2009-09-05

Everything from Easy Spirit is superior to those now-failed shoe redesigns.  Sole is very grippy on urban/suburban walkways and driveways in fall, winter and spring precipitation.  VERY easy to slip into. Initially feared it was too open for winter wear, but in my experience decent midweight-to-heavy socks carry you through Jan.-Feb.-Mar. in upper midwest without cold feet.  (If you plow through deep snow you will need a boot of course.)  I've sprayed my Everything shoes with waterproofing and the suede takes it beautifully; first spray in Sept.-Oct. and then reapply later winter to make it through puddles of Mar.=Apr.  Brown still looks velvety after two Wisconsin winters; khaki/tan/taupe held up well too.  Oct. 2014 ordered nice neutral dark green for color variety.  The Everything was harder to find in my size this autumn, otherwise still pleased with quality of manufacture.  &#34;Everyday&#34; is a similar shoe with faux fur (alas I didn't like center seam on top of foot) and 1 or more Easy Spirit clogs appear to have the same great-gripping outsole if you like that Everything feature in a backless style.	2014-10-14
US	49179005	R2ONMMTBODZ9UG	B004XGBSDK	631360696	Baggallini Criss Cross Bagg	Shoes	5	0	0	N	N	great small bag	I love this purse enough to buy one in a second color. It is fairly small but holds a lot. It is true, as another reviewer noted, that the middle section does not stay closed, but I use it for things that I want to grab quickly but are not costly should they fall out. I'll describe what I carry moving from the small zipper section in front and moving backward.<br />  Here is what I routinely carry:<br />In the small front zipper section, I put in a lipstick, small mirror and my cell phone, which is a fold over<br />In the next zipper section behind this pocket, I use the center zipper section of it for currency and change, the four credit card slots for at least six cards, my license and health care cards. The remainder, I put in the convenient little zipper pocket in there. I also put in a folding hair brush, and a few pens.<br /> In the next large section includes my appointment book, check book and sometimes my digital camera.  It would also hold a kindle. A regular water bottle would fit but the section may not zip completely but that would depend on how it is positioned.<br />  The middle section,holds hand sanitizer, mints, hanky, shopping lists, coupons and sometimes my keys although I usually clip them on the handle.<br /> Second larger section holds treats for my small breed service dog, a small wallet with her Service Dog IDs and a folding water bowl. Sometimes I include an 8oz bottle of water.<br />  There is an open pocket in the back that I usually don't use because I simply don't carry much else, but I might put in a church bulletin or something of that kind.<br />  Like all baggallinis, it washes beautifully and seems more than durable. I would certainly recommend it to those who like a smaller bag but can't quite do with the triple zip.	2013-11-12

I picked up a black pair here, when they were having the summer sale and I got it with the 20% discount, which was a killer deal.<br /><br />As far as the quality of the glasses go. I agree with Mark Twain \\""Chris\\"" review. The lenses, through time, have definitely been harder to clean due to the oily build up from my eyes, sweat, eyeglass cleaner, etc. There is now a smudgy haze, throughout the inside lenses, that doesn't seem to want to come off. Granted, I've had my original glasses (Seaweed) for about two years, but still.<br /><br />Also, about 3 months into having my original glasses. One of the lenses popped out. Kaenon replaced them for me, free of charge, but that was kind of a bummer, since I bought them originally for $250 + tax. They still aren't right. Every time I clean it (wipe it down), the lenses creak and feel like they are about to pop out.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend these glasses because they do look good without looking too huge on your face. I am just a little sketchy about the quality."	2012-06-06

I was having trouble with my old road shoes getting stuck in the pedals and had lost confidence in using them. These shoes have changed all that. I bought the double sided pedals to go with them, making it much easier to click in. I still do a bit of 'walking' up the hills and these shoes are easy to walk in with the recessed cleat. They do run a little bit small so half to one size bigger would be advisable. (eg. I wear 41 in Birkenstock. Bought 42 in these)  But thanks to other reviews I took that into consideration and now have a great pair of good looking, comfy, excellent quality shoes. Oh, and a fraction of the price we can get them here in Australia. I am so sorry for our local businesses but you can't beat Amazon!	2012-11-10

I've spent $250 on boots before, some Oboz that are some sick backpacking boots but as soon as my feet swell up, it's game over and the pain (and golf ball sized blisters) begin. This is on a 6 mile FLAT trail too. So I thought the Danners would be a small upgrade, but not night & day. My requirements were simple... I needed something that could handle a heavy pack in remote areas, handle my high arches gracefully, and not give me unbearable blisters. Met and exceeded with these boots.<br /><br />I've done 6 miles in the Danners, blister free! With the heavy pack on! I was surprised at how comfy the original insoles are, but I put in my Superfeet shortly after and they're even more comfortable and personalized.<br /><br />These are burly, heavy boots. The weight is hardly bothersome in my opinion, but something to note. If you're reading this, you're likely not in need of casual boots but in something that will perform very well. These boots deliver and justify their own price. You can't get new shoes in the middle of a hike when the blisters get bad. Just order these now. Amazon's price is very good compared to everywhere else.<br /><br />Note on the images, the leather on the boot is much more pretty than that awful product pic makes it look. Google images for the boots instead of trusting these!<br /><br />- - - - -<br /><br />July 2015 Update, post-Nepal travels<br /><br />These boots were one of the best investments I made towards my trip. 6/5 stars.

So I went on the search for  something to make it so that I could wirelessly charge my phone. I was honestly getting tired of plugging it in each night, I didn't want to make my charging port getting lose and not holding the plug. This was really easy to install on my phone, as it already was equipped, but needed the attachment to make it work. It goes above the battery before you get to the back. I do highly recommend this! I did receive my Charger receiver at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.	2015-08-19

"Update 6/5/13:<br />I started running out of battery quickly, and could not figure out why. Well, I now know the problem(s). I turned everything on. If you turn on every bit of technology this phone has to offer, you'll go through the battery faster than a Ferrari goes through gas. I would run out of charge in 14 hours....with very little use. I am now trying to figure out what I can't live without. I still think I have a lot to learn on this phone, especially having discovered \\""developer mode.\\"" You will not find it in your settings. It is hidden. To \\""unlock\\"" it, here's what you have to do: Go to Settings, then go to About Device then scroll down to Build Number and tap it 7 times (I later heard you can tap 5 times, but I did 7). You'll get a little pop up saying that you have enabled developer mode. You can now debug USB, etc.....just when I thought I was getting to the meat of the phone, I discover all these other things. I'm going to keep searching, I might even find a personal cloaking device in here! ;)<br /><br />One more thing, be careful with contact info. I accidently merged two accounts, and so one was deleted. I had to manually re-enter it.<br /><br />Original:<br />It's nice to have a phone with such a large, brite screen....especially when your eyes aren't as good as they used to be. We had iPhone 5's and they were fine, but there was a lot missing. Let me first tell you that the phone is pretty amazing, but also has some quirks. I am not an Apple hater (we have several ipads, including 2 mini's), and I was tempted to stay with the iphones, however, since we were able to upgrade, we thought we'd give it a chance. Keep in mind that I used to have a Samsung Brightside (dumb phone) and I HATED it, so it was tough to get these.<br /><br />Obviously, the ability to throw in a 64 gig card, pull it out, and put everything onto my computer/external drive, etc., and I have to say, it is very convenient. Another wonderful thing is the battery. It lasts a long, Imean LONG, time. One thing to note, if you let it drop to below 15% charge, it says that it could effect how well"	2013-05-28

The design has several major drawbacks. One, it is somewhat bulky and the hard plastic and rounded back makes is difficult to hold and slippery. In fact, I'm surprised that I haven't dropped it yet. Another major flaw is that the case covers up the charging port on the bottom of the iPhone and uses a separate plug that comes with the case. This means that you can't use your standard charger and have to carry around another plug when you travel - this may only be an issue for me because I carry two iPhones, one personal and one for business but I now need two different chargers. With this alternate charging port, it's a little odd because it seems like you are not directly charging your phone, you charge the case and then transfer the power from the case to the phone. This seems inefficient because I would prefer to keep the extra battery charged and just directly charge the phone, only using the backup power from the phone when needed. It's also possible that I am using the charger the wrong way but it is difficult to tell because it came with almost no instructions.	2014-02-23

Right out of the box, the software to upgrade maps did not work.  Didn't send it back in time, so ended up using it.  I live in a rural area, and it more-often-than-not cannot find a satellite until I get near a town.  But the major problem with it is that the light goes out automatically (as an energy-saving feature, I suppose) after only a few minutes and then will not come back on.  It is supposed to light back up if you touch it, but it doesn't.  I went into the settings and set it to NEVER automatically turn off, but it still turns off after about 1 minute.  You cannot see the map without the light.  The only way to use this GPS is to pull over, turn it off, turn it back on, plug in the directions again, and then try to memorize where to go before the light turns off again.  I can pull off the road with a paper road atlas and get the directions faster with a lot less frustration.<br />  I had an inexpensive Garmin that was hard to read but worked well for 3 years; it was stolen.  This was supposed to be an upgrade.  I can't imagine why anyone would give this lemon a good review.	2015-07-26

US	34266154	R3OO6ISG1P9IKK	B004877KOK	173759440	Motorola Roadster Bluetooth In-Car Speakerphone	Wireless	4	1	1	N	Y	Good not great	I spend a lot of time in my car for work, so I've moved past the radio and listen to audiobooks to break the monotony of mile after mind-numbing mile of flat, Midwestern interstate.  After listening to the entire 'Harry Potter' series on headphones, I decided I needed to find a better way and purchased a Roadster.    Since my primary motivation to buy the Roadster was the A2DP streaming through the FM transmitter, that was the first thing I tested, and I was satisfied.  I have used FM transmitters before, and I had pretty low expectations particularly because I live in a major city.  However, 87.9 FM tended to be very reliable and I experienced only sporadic static.  This improved a little when I switched from my 2004 Honda Civic to my wife's 2006 VW Jetta but was still present occasionally.  As far as FM transmitters go, this one was ahead of the pack based on past experiences.    The phone function was good, but not great, hence the title of this review and my grade of four stars.  On the listening end, I had no problem hearing the other person.  The FM transmitter's performance during calls was about the same as in A2DP mode.  The Roadster lost it's star on the talking end; I had several complaints about people not being able to hear me.  They tended to be 800 numbers and other business calls, whereas my friends and family seemed to be able to hear me well more often than not.  I'm not sure if that's because they were more tolerant of small interruptions or because of something on the receiving end with business calls.      For reference purposes, my Civic was totaled in an accident about a month after I bought the Roadster.  I bought a 2011 Chevrolet Cruze with built-in Bluetooth to replace it, and those whom I've asked have all said they can hear me better in the Cruze than they could in the Civic.  I'm sure there are several factors (road noise, distance to mic, etc.) that factor in, but I thought it was worth noting.    Overall, the Roadster is a good productand worth the price, especially for people that spend a lot of time in the car.	2011-08-15

So this was listed as the #1 bestseller on Amazon, and I didn't want to pay a higher price on a pioneer for the upgrade on a relatively older car (5 years old) so decided to take the plunge.<br />Here are the drawbacks I noticed once i started using it  -<br />1. Navigation only says turn left in 50 feet etc. - doesn't read out any street names - you need to look that up on the screen. I called Jensen support and they said no text-speech available to announce street names.<br />2. Even in verbose mode the navigation announcement is not efficient and timely - use google navigation and then this - you'll see what I mean - it's a big step down from the navigation on google maps.<br />3. There is a lag in the GPS tracking - it says turn left in some feet when you're already at the turn - so you need to watch out - to be specific it was off by like 25 feet.<br />4. Software is average - sometimes the buttons lag when ur typing.<br />5. When you turn on the radio, the default volume level is pretty high!! It made me jump many a times whenever I turned on the radio on a quiet evening drive - immediately you will need to lower the volume - unless you are the types who likes to blast radio lol.<br /><br />Looking at all this, I decided to spend an extra 250-300 and buy a pioneer instead. Have filed return.	2015-03-30

I have an [[ASIN:B005SSB4NG Apple iPhone 4S 32GB (Black) - AT&T]], an [[ASIN:B00746VKG6 Apple iPad MD368LL/A (64GB, Wi-Fi + AT&T 4G, Black) NEWEST MODEL]], and a number of old iPods. They all connect to my [[ASIN:B007471PZQ Apple MacBook Pro MC975LL/A 15.4-Inch Laptop with Retina Display (NEWEST VERSION)]] or one of two [[ASIN:B001U0OH8K Apple iMac MB419LL/A 24-Inch Desktop]] and even [[ASIN:B006Y443TU Pioneer AVIC-X940BT In-Dash Navigation AV Receiver with 6.1\\"" WVGA Touchscreen and Built-In Bluetooth]]. So what this means is that my devices are constantly being charged or synched.<br /><br />Obviously, I love Apple produced, but here's my beef. The 3\\"" sync cables are too small and not rugged.<br /><br />The Belkin cable is very sturdy and is a foot longer. This can make a difference depending on how and where you you use it. For instance I charge my iPad at night. If the cable by my bed is too short I have to unplug my iPad to use it. All that unplugging wears on the cable and soon I find myself out buying another.<br /><br />With this cable, two problems solved."	2012-07-06

When I got this phone case I made sure to put some clear nail polish over the diamonds to make sure they didn't fall off so fast. They still did fall off, but the case was super cute that I didn't really care about the few missing diamonds. After having the case on my phone for a few weeks, it started to randomly hit the lock and unlock button without me doing so. It also would make it so that when I was in a phone conversation, the screen wouldn't go black, which means that my face would put it on mute. As soon as I took off the case the problem went away. I really would like to keep the case on my phone because its cute, but it is not very functional.	2012-11-27

It recently became clear to me that chargers aren't meant to last a lifetime, but with the life time warranty that this product offers it basically lasts forever. These chargers, surprisingly charger faster than even some of the 3ft after market cables I have. Also which really shocked me about this product that it charger my iPad mini very quick. Usually to charge my iPad i would almost always have to connect it to my 3ft cables rather than my other 6ft cables, but with these i have options.<br /><br />I ordered the black&white bundle and unfortunately they both stopped working; with the white cable defecting before the black. The malfunction of the product might have been my fault for not taking the best care of these cables but I was able to get a replacement bundle within days after i emailed The Friendly Swede. They replied quickly every time and handled our transaction with my replacements(via. life time warranty) with amazing customer service. A few questions were asked and a few photos of mien were sent to them of my cables, and they easily complied to a replacement. Highly recommended.<br /><br />P.s they also told me that they recently changed manufactures which now make this product even better than before and more sturdy.	2014-09-09

The sound quality on these speakers was mediocre which was surprising because I put it in my shower (where I always just sound so great). Hooking it up to my phone was very easy and the battery lasted for several weeks before needing to be recharged (I only used it in the shower). It stays in place really well, seriously the only thing I was disappointed about was the sound, which was just okay but decent enough for me to continue using it.	2015-08-01

Works great, charges both my iPhone and iPad quickly, and holds charge for a very long time. The only complaint i have about this product is that it did not include a wall USB charger.
