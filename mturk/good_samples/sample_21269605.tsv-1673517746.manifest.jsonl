But I gotta warn you, the solid black portion is made out of the same silken material that they make some sleep gowns- it's stretchy, mostly matte, but thin. Don't get me wrong, I don't think that makes it a sleep gown, in fact I don't think most people would be able to identify the material while its on you (unless they're UP on you, in which case I doubt they are there to be feeling your dress' material), and as a bonus it make it even more comfortable than most other dresses. But the warning here it, don't wear something that will give you visible lines, as this wont hide them, and don't but it too tight. The sizing is on spot, I'm a medium/ 6-10 (I vary depending on the brand) and I bought an 8, and it fits like a charm. The mesh is sturdy enough for mesh. I don't expect this will withstand me doing tactical maneuvers through bushes, but I'm not buying it for that, plus at this price you can buy a backup!\"]", "metadata": [{"marketplace": "US", "customer_id": 25349639, "review_id": "RPLDX5KW29LFZ", "product_id": "B0044R7VRK", "product_parent": 213274529, "product_title": "Bravado Men's Black Label Society Skull Shield T-shirt", "product_category": "Apparel", "star_rating": 5, "helpful_votes": 1, "total_votes": 1, "vine": "N", "verified_purchase": "Y", "review_headline": "My brother loves it!", "review_date": "2011-01-13"}, {"marketplace": "US", "customer_id": "44875635", "review_id": "R1K6BT6NOEODOK", "product_id": "B00T4XMBQ0", "product_parent": "434503231", "product_title": "Foxy FNAF Mens T-Shirt Five Nights at Horror Freddys Video Game New Black", "product_category": "Apparel", "star_rating": "5", "helpful_votes": "0", "total_votes": "0", "vine": "N", "verified_purchase": "Y", "review_headline": "She was very happy with it", "review_date": "2015-08-31", "label": {"isFlagged": true, "annotations": [], "customUsageOptions": [], "replacementClasses": {}}, "inspectionTime": 816}, {"marketplace": "US", "customer_id": 49078870, "review_id": "R2UY78TUXN3QQ1", "product_id": "B00N1PZBVO", "product_parent": 321163371, "product_title": "6 Praziquantel 30mg capsules treats tapeworms in cats and dogs from PetsNeedMeds", "product_category": "Pet Products", "star_rating": 5, "helpful_votes": 1, "total_votes": 1, "vine": "N", "verified_purchase": "Y", "review_headline": "It worked in one dose as promised.

A little messy to use, but it works well.\", \"I put two of these in my bedroom over the winter and they seemed to really help with my dry skin and nose. We have gas heat, which is notoriously dry. I had used a humidifier in the past, but I didn't like how it sprayed water mist everywhere and left the area around it all wet. I also didn't like how it got all of that funky pink mold in it and was nearly impossible to clean because of all of the crevices. I decided to try these to see if that would eliminate the need for the humidifier. They really did!<br /><br />You do have to fill them with water every day, but if you just add that to your nighttime routine, you get used to it. They are also plastic, and kind of flimsy on the top. Not super flimsy, but if your regular metal registers support something like a nightstand, or if you step on them regularly, you will not be able to do that with these.<br /><br />Aside from that, these did the job, did not get gross and moldy, and are pretty inexpensive. I am very happy with this purchase.\", \"I read all the reviews on this phone carefully before buying and was a little bit anxious when I did decide to purchase it.

I love the ease at which you can switch between internet and land phone. The range is very impressive and you can comfortably sit some distance from the base and get excellent sound quality.

{"source": "[\"Love being able to recharge my Kindle with this adapter,  it charges faster than on my computer.  Easy to use with the charging cord that comes with your Kindle\", \"Very Nice, wish it was normal headphone pads, not a big fan of earbuds they never seem to stay in nice in my ears, but I guess to be water resistant you need to put up with it, Drag and drop on OSX Snow Lion and Mavericks, shows up like a flash drive (No Need For Itunes).  It dosn't generate playlists like other mp3 players Ive owned. But it does appear to support folders, So I have 4 activies Boxing,Biking,Dancing,Weightlifting, all have different music for the activities, and I can change folder by a button. Shuffle appears to stay in the folder and not shuffling all 4 folders like most mp3 players. It does support playlists but on OSX you will need to make them yourself. I think I tried to do it with VLC, but I can't tell if the select folder or playlists is working, the same select button does both. Either way it works, just not clear which is working. Its great being cordless for activity, I can't tell you how many times the cord has got in the way of boxing, weightlifting, dancing, so its worth every penny for those activities, the water resistant feature will ensure it won't die the first 90 degree day im biking 20 miles, (I hope) I haven't tried that yet with it, but so far its surviving brutal sweaty elliptical sessions and dancing. So far so good, It is weaker then other mp3 players, not as loud, if you want loud music especially for dancing this could be a little weak. They are pretty chunky I was expecting it to be like my Bluetooth headset size, they are alot thicker and heavier. I have a very big head also so it stays pretty snug, but smaller heads that don't like earbuds this might not stay in your ears nice.

Lenny was (with emphasis on the was) supposed to be a durability scale of 9 (out of 10).  He did last longer than the Lion - with a durability rating of 7 - but the lion lasted less than 10 minutes before the stuffing and squeaker was being pulled out.  Lenny lasted longer, about 10 hours total time, with maybe an hour of serious attack time.  His ears were gone within 10 minutes, and by the morning of day two, he too was having the stuffing pulled out.  Maybe the unstuffed toys from VIP will last longer.  Our dog uses her front teeth to pull at the fabric until she can create a tear. She did enjoy it - so that's why it got a \\\\\\\\\\\"3\\\\\\\\\\\", but we have to find something else, she manages to extract every bit of stuffing from these stuffed animals.

It's been drenched in sweat countless times and I've even fallen while wearing it trail running and still no tears and no signs of it falling apart. This shirt is also good for days when you leave and it's chilly, but becomes warmer as the sun comes up. It will keep the chill off your skin, but is breathable and won't cause you to overheat as the day warms up. I recently ran the Grand Canyon in the shirt. It was 19 deg. when we left in the AM and in the 80's as we climbed up the South Rim. The shirt was perfect for both situations. I agree with previous posts that the sizing is a bit small.

{"source": "[\"Shipped as expected and on time.  Instructions were excellent and easy to understand and follow. Works great.\", \"UPDATE -- BUYER BEWARE: I've owned these headphones for about seven months, and the headband just snapped FOR THE SECOND TIME. The headband broke the first time after about 4 months of regular use. Mailed them back and Beyer repaired them for free. However, they just snapped again three months later. I'm totally convinced this is a design flaw, because they broke at the same location both times, and the plastic is quite thin at that part of the headband. I've emailed Beyer to see if they'll give me a credit toward a different model, but I'm not optimistic. It's a bummer, because the sound and comfort of the DTX 350p was very good.<br /><br />Original Review:<br />Pros: Lightweight, comfortable enough to wear for several hours with occasional adjustments, very little microphonics, good sound at low to mid volume<br />Cons: Sound balance becomes harsher at higher volumes, short cable, very little isolation<br /><br />Design/Build Quality (Good): These headphones look great. I love the minimal, all-black design. The logos are small and not in your face. The plastic frame is lightweight, but doesn't feel flimsy. The build feels fairly solid overall. Headband adjusts easily and has a thin metal support band inside. All the hinges and swivels feel solid, not loose or creaky. I like the flat &#34;no-twist&#34; cables, although a single-ear connection point would have been better. There are almost no microphonics when the cable brushes against my clothing, which is good. However, the cable length is too short, imo. I bought an extension to use these with my desktop (which sits on the floor beneath my desk). If you're using these with a phone or DAP, you'll be fine.<br /><br />Comfort (Very Good): They felt a tad snug out of the box, but I stretched them overnight, and they now feel pretty close to perfect. The clamping force is not overbearing, yet they feel stable on my head. The earcups are a good size and provide a good amount of padding. The apex of the headband is also nicely padded. I can wear these for six or more hours sitting at my desk without any problems, and I have a fairly large head. The swivels ensure that the cups rest flatly against the ears.<br /><br />Sound (Pretty Good): I'm not a hardcore audiophile, so I can't go into tremendous depth on the nuances here, but I'll do my best.\", \"Love this cute little thing! I use this one for my kids to practice whenever they have a part in church! easy to use but the unit doesn't have an on-off button. you really have to plug or unplug the cable whenever you want to turn it on or off. the part of the cable where you have to insert it to the unit is not so protected for whatever yanking movement that may happen during using the unit, so be careful not to damage it.\", \"Pros:<br />Cheap<br />Easy assembly<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cheap breaks, barely work<br />Needs shifter tuning, brake alignment (additional tuning 50-70 dollars)<br />Cheap tires<br />extremely heavy frame<br /><br />This is my first road bike/commuter bike.

I squirted them with water twice a day as needed as the saran wrap leaves plenty of air to breathe out the sides and it is extremely dry where I live in the winter.

Just remember if you have a newer laptop that has UEFI and you are going to clone your old drive, make sure the cloning tool supports UEFI.  I was able to use a trial version of a piece of software to get it done.  First tool I used I would get an error on boot.  Also had issues with updating the firmware for my drive.  the boot disk or USB drive would not load the firmware updater.  So I used another computer and the firmware update went fine. Also make sure you turn off file indexing and turn trim support on in Windows.  Got this drive from Amazon Gold Box deal for $150.  Best price I have seen.  It was way to good to pass up.

The B&D had a 90 minute timer (as opposed to the 60 minute timer on this model), it was well insulated (no insulation on this model), had a separate toast function (this unit has a separate toast setting, but still uses the timer, which generally results in under or overdone toast), the thermostat on the B&D was generally reliable (this one is hit or miss), and the B&D heated evenly (this unit has hot spots that result in blackening of food in some areas). I guess it was worth the $20 (I paid $35 for the B&D 15 years ago), but I wouldn't buy it again.\", \"Great pattern and the red bow tie was true to description.\", \"so far so good. great picture, easy to attach stand and set up\", \"(53 years old - Female) Been using this product since last November (2013) and I have to say that I am very pleased with it, overall. It came to me well boxed, with protective foam padding that holds all of the glass attachments. Go ahead and trash the instructions...they are useless and laughable. Lots of info online about how to use this and get the best benefits.<br /><br />I use mine with Pond's Rejuveness cream, but you can use many other products, as other reviewers have pointed out.<br /><br />Wasn't expecting miracles with this, but I can honestly say that my skin looks (and feels) fresher and healthier, and my pores are shrinking, which is a very nice thing to happen. I get a little rosy glow just after I use it, so the real difference is seen the next day; for me, anyway. The lines in my forehead have diminished greatly, and are continuing to do so. My crow's feet and dark circles (hereditary!) are on their way out too.<br /><br />I usually work on one area of my face at a time, giving each area about 3 or 4 minutes, and going back to zap the deeper lines when I'm finished. It's actually very relaxing, and can be done watching TV, without much thought or effort.<br /><br />It doesn't hurt when you use it. Just start off with the lowest setting and work your way up. Especially if you use the &#34;sparkle&#34; technique for deeper lines. That can be a little &#34;ouchie&#34; if you zap yourself with a high setting, so definitely start low with that.<br /><br />You're going to get out of it what you put into it, make no mistake. Use it every day, and you'll see results. Use it once in awhile when you think of it, and you won't see results.<br /><br />All in all, it's a really nice at home skin treatment that makes me feel pampered. No regrets with this purchase at all.\", \"Better fit than original for a great low price...! I buy lots of used lenses/bodies that many times are missing these caps, I bought 10 sets so I have plenty of spares for the future...

{"source": "[\"I was played like a fool by by the seller of the watch i purchased \\\\\\\\\\\"MYJEWELRYBOX.COM,  i search around on amazon til i found the watch i was looking for, read some reviews before the purchase, and shortly after i ordered the watch you see to the right of this page. The Bulova Men's Marine Star Calendar Watch w/the rose-gold ion plated finish which was $299.99.  I went to Bulova.com to double check the item # 98B104 everything i entered was correct even on the receipt amazon sent me.  Tell me why when i got the watch it was a completely different watch i didn't order #98B127 stainless steel finish which was $189.99.  MY JEWELRYBOX.COM TRICK THE SH** out of me! When i called them they tried to tell me that amazon.com listed the item # wrong & it was their problem i would have had to wait God only knows how long to get the correct watch, and they couldn't give me a time, date, or nothing!!!  I called them several times after to speak to a mgr, but no one mgr wanted to talk to me. They were very rude people!  The watch was for my Fiance's birthday, i ordered the watch 2 wks before his surprise birthday party.  They charged me over $100 more than what the watch was going for on amazon, i knew the #98B104 watch was more money and i didn't have a problem with that it was when they shipped me the #98B127 the watch i didn't order, that became the ISSUE!  I was so upset i called, and filed a complaint with amazon and still to this day i have not heard anything from amazon either no call, no email nothing!.  I kept the watch i gave it to him anyway even though that was not the watch he wanted, but he was very understanding and grateful for the gift! I felt like i owed him something more so I ordered him another watch an authentic Breitling Chrono-Matic 49 from a license retailer and he loves it! The lesson learned is sometimes you have to pay for good quality service, and not just being cheap looking for a deal. Don't get me wrong i love deals, but sometimes BS comes along with it!!  I will NEVER ORDER FROM THEM AGAIN! BE CAREFUL\", \"I hate this printer.  I got it super cheap when a local Circuit City closed down and sold off floor models.  I design business cards, pamplets, etc. on my computer as a side business while going to college and suffice to say, printing them on this printer can't happen.  Nothing lines up correctly.  It completly ignores the margins I've set.  Everything prints at a slanted angle.  And then to make it even better, it will print say 3 pages perfect and then never print it right again. I have to say that this printer works great for printing non-coloured documents, but DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER if you need it to print on anything other than standard paper.  It will not do it.\", \"This was the best! I am so bummed SodaStream isn't making this anymore. It was tart, tangy and delicious. I guess not many folks were big fans of it but I was.

It was tough to spend more on the knife, but this takes it to a whole next level of awesomeness.  Totally worth the money.\", \"I LOVE THIS! It works perfectly and we use it every day. I have a large family and it keeps the mess to a minimum in the morning. My 14 year old son woke me up the first morning before school to tell me that it was so good he wanted to cry!

In each pair the liner is not properly affixed to the leather in the left toe area, causing the liner material to hang down and rub against the top of the toe.  Right shoe is fine in both pairs, the liner is properly bonded to the top of the shoe.  These were purchased directly from amazon, although they now show them being sold by Planet Shoes, for a little more money (still less than retail).  Seems that Amazon bought a batch of defective shoes from Keen and just plans to sell them to their customers.
