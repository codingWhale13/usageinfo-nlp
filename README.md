# Learning to Predict Usage Options of Product Reviews with LLM-Generated Labels

This repository provides the paper and code of **[Learning to Predict Usage Options of Product Reviews with LLM-Generated Labels](paper.pdf)**, a study that explores different annotation approaches for solving a complex task.

## Introduction

Annotating large datasets can be challenging. However, crowd-sourcing is often expensive and can lack quality, especially for non-trivial tasks. We propose a method of using LLMs as few-shot learners for annotating data in a complex natural language task where we learn a standalone model to predict usage options for products from customer reviews. Learning a custom model offers individual control over energy efficiency and privacy measures compared to using the LLM directly for the sequence-to-sequence task. We compare this data annotation approach with other traditional methods and demonstrate how LLMs can enable considerable cost savings. We find that the quality of the resulting data exceeds the
level attained by third-party vendor services and that GPT-4-generated labels even reach the level of domain experts.

## Reproducibility

1. Cloning of the repository with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aiintelligentsystems/learning-with-llm-labels
cd learning-with-llm-labels
```

2. Download the [data](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html)
```bash
python src/data_download.py <data-path> data/reviews.json
```

3. Create a conda environment

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate paper
```

4. Annotation
For annotation we have provided our labels:

```bash
python json-cli.py merge_labels data/reviews.json prompt_evaluation_set_labels.json data/prompt_evaluation_reviews.json
python json-cli.py merge_labels data/reviews.json training_set_labels.json data/training_reviews.json
python json-cli.py merge_labels data/reviews.json evaluation_set_labels.json data/evaluation_reviews.json
```
To label using the OpenAI API use the following commands:
```bash
python src/openai_api/openai_labelling.py data/reviews.json
python src/openai_api/openai_labelling.py data/reviews.json -p 6_shot
python src/openai_api/openai_labelling.py data/reviews.json -p COT_2_shot
python src/openai_api/openai_labelling.py data/reviews.json -p COT_6_shot
```
The prompts can be found in src/openai_api/prompts.json

5. Dataset creation
Create for each label source a training and validation dataset. If you have our label names you can use create_dataset.sh to create all necessary datasets 
```bash
python src/helpers/create_dataset.py datasets/dataset_name label_ids_to_use data/reviews.json
```

6. Training
Use the configs provided in src/training/trainings_configs to train the models
```bash
python src/training/train.py --config <config_path>
```

7. Annotation
To annotate specify the file, the model artifact and a label id you want to use:
```bash
python json-cli.py score <file> <model_checkpoint_name> <suffix_label_id>
```

To reproduce Table 2 and 3 specify flan-t5-base and llama2-70B rather than a model artifact and use -p to specify the prompt_id.

8. Scoring
To score we have provided a own conda enviroment:
```bash
conda env create -f src/evaluation/environment.yml
conda activate evaluation
```
To score:
```bash
python json-cli.py score <file> <reference_label_id> <label_id>
```
You can use wildcards to specify labels and can get an overview of all labels using:
```bash
python json-cli.py stats <file>
```

9. Test
Use the evaluation enviroment as above. To test you have to have scored the labels you want to test:
```bash
python json-cli.py test <file> <reference_label_id> <label_id_1> <label_id_2>
```
