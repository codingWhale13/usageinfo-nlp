  - no_use_cases:
    - bad_product: The iPad does not stand up at all in vertical position and poorly in horizontal position . Makes it hard to work
    - gift_no_use_cases: Bought this as a gift , and it looks amazing . The only reason I gave it a 4 is that the nose is kind of uncomfortable , so you have to turn it away from your palm .
  - one_use_case:
    - smartphone_easy_test: The smartphone is perfect for taking pictures or browsing the web
    - treating_fleas_for_cats: My cat had the worst flea infestation she had ever had. Because is 15 years old i feared giving her a treatment to toxic and thus harmful.  Capstar worked within ONE HOUR! I worried about how to give  her a pill. No problem, crushed the pill and mixed with wet food. Again, it worked like noting else and NO side effects. Now one pill a week does the trick.
